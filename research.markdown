@Cox-Realism 

Abstract: This essay provides meta-ethical foundations for an approach to political realism. The foundations appeal to the kind of non-objectivity of morality involved in taking a critical and reflective perspective on our own moral and political outlooks. The essay argues that the distinctive methodology of an approach to political realism can be derived from these non-objectivist foundations. This methodology requires political philosophy to be more critical and reflective than it usually is, for it to be more deeply engaged with history, sociology, and other human sciences, and for it to look less like applied moral philosophy.

@Cox-Reflections

Abstract: On the 14th of October 2023, the Australian people voted overwhelmingly against the proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament. Only 40% of voters supported the proposal. What are the implications of this outcome for how we think about legitimacy and justice in Australia? This chapter examines some of the data and analysis that has emerged since the referendum and ask how it bears on questions of legitimacy and justice. It reflects on some of the arguments that were offered for the Voice considering the outcome of the referendum with a focus on arguments for the Voice which cast the proposal as a way of addressing the legitimacy deficit faced by the Australian state with respect to its exercise of political power and authority over Indigenous Australians. It then asks what the outcome of the referendum tells us about the prospects for legitimating the exercise of power and authority of the Australian state over Indigenous Australians.

@Cox-ARB

Abstract: How are sentences that express reason explanations related to sentences which express rationalizing psychological explanations? How are sentences like ‘Jane is going to the pub because John is there’ related to sentences like ‘Jane is going to the pub because she knows that John is there’? Are the former merely elliptical, in some sense, for the latter? Are the former used to express nothing more and nothing less than the latter are used to express? If so, then what explains this? Are the sentences syntactically ambiguous, context-dependent, lexically ambiguous, or is there some merely pragmatic explanation available? This paper examines various linguistic hypotheses which would support the “ellipsis hypothesis” and argues that they all fail to support the hypothesis. It then argues that this has deeper implications for first-order action theory than one might think, as the failure of these hypotheses lends support to an alternative first-order action theory I call analytic anti-psychologism.

@Cox-Class

Abstract: This essay argues for an expansion of the egalitarian toolbox for critiquing systems of education from the point of view of social justice. It begins by examining familiar egalitarian approaches to equality of opportunity and social justice before examining more recent approaches to expanding the egalitarian toolbox defended by Elizabeth Anderson and Debra Satz, approaches which appeal to the notions of democratic equality and equal democratic citizenship respectively. It argues that while both the familiar and new approaches form an important part of the egalitarian toolbox, they both have limitations which call for an approach to educational justice more directly concerned with social equality. The essay then develops such an approach based on a sociologically informed approach to social class and social status.

@Cox-Models

Abstract: My aim in this paper is twofold: (i) to develop a framework for thinking about different models of self-knowledge and (ii) to offer some considerations in favour of one model. The framework I develop combines two methodologies: Gricean creature construction and model building in philosophy. Together these methodologies constitute a fruitful methodology for exploring questions in the philosophical psychology of self-knowledge. I begin by describing the basic subject that will form the basis for the construction of more sophisticated self-knowing subjects. I will then, largely by way of illustration of the model building approach, describe a model of self-knowledge that our basic subject already satisfies, namely the inferential model, and argue that the model is clearly inadequate as a model of self-knowing subjects like ourselves. I then briefly describe the self-scanning model, primarily as a way of introducing an important desideratum and setting the scene for the rest of the discussion. I then describe several models of self-knowledge which seek to vindicate the “transparency observation”, offering some brief evaluative remarks on each model. I then raise a puzzle about deliberative models of self-knowledge before describing and defending what I take to be the most promising version of the deliberative model of self-knowledge.

@Cox-Voice 

*Abstract:* This essay sets out an argument from legitimacy for the proposed
Indigenous Voice to Parliament in Australia. The essay first sets out an
understanding of political legitimacy and of legitimacy deficits and argues
that the Australian Government faces a legitimacy deficit with respect to its
exercise of political power and authority over Indigenous Australians. The
deficit arises, it is argued, because Indigenous Australians face significant
structural injustice and there is little hope of redressing this injustice
within the prevailing governing conventions. The essay then argues that the
proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament ought to be seen as part of a package
to address this legitimacy deficit by resetting the governing conventions of
Australian society. The argument from legitimacy is then compared favourably with more familiar arguments from sovereignty and the right to
self-determination.

@Cox-Equality

*Abstract:* This essay explores the nature of the relation between democracy and social equality. It critically evaluates the egalitarian view that democracy is necessary for full social equality and that democracy is an important constituent of social equality. On such a view, inequalities in power and de facto authority are taken, in certain circumstances, and in the absence of certain dispositions to refrain from exercising such power and authority, to constitute a form of social inequality. On the basis of a series of cases, I argue that such a view is mistaken, and that political inequalities are, at best, causally and contingently related to social inequality. I argue that a better explanation of what is wrong with inequalities in power and de facto authority in many cases is that they can be used to extract greater consideration for those with greater power.

@Cox-Distinctness

*Abstract:* Claims about the distinctness or non-distinctness of introspective
beliefs from the mental states they are about have played a central role in the
philosophy of introspection in the past fifty years or so. In *A Materialist
Theory of the Mind* and work leading up to it, David Armstrong famously argued
against infallibilist theories of introspection, and in defence of his own
self-scanning theory of introspection, on the ground that introspective beliefs
are distinct from the mental states they are about. Sydney Shoemaker, one of
Armstrong’s most ardent critics, famously argued against Armstrong’s
self-scanning theory of introspection, and in favour of his own constitutive
theory of introspection, on the ground that introspective beliefs are not
distinct from the mental states they are about. Yet the relevant sense or
senses of distinctness involved here, and the role such claims about
distinctness plays in such arguments, is notoriously hard to pin down. This
essay explores some of the issues concerning distinctness and non-distinctness
in the philosophy of introspection and in the dispute between Armstrong and
Shoemaker and offers a reassessment of some of the central arguments offered in
that dispute.

@Cox-Incapacity

*Abstract:*  Are the limits on what we can do, morally speaking---our "moral
incapacities" as Bernard Williams calls them---imposed on us from within, by
reason itself, or from without, by something other than reason? Do they perhaps
have their source in the will, as opposed to reason? In this essay, I argue for
a theory of moral incapacity on which our moral incapacities have their source
in reason itself. The theory is defended on the grounds that it provides the
best explanation of our  knowledge  of our own moral incapacities. I argue that
just as an agent's reflective commitments play an essential role in the
explanation of their knowledge of their moral incapacities, they play an
essential role in the explanation of moral incapacities themselves. Since
reflective commitments are rational commitments, and rational commitments have
their source in reason, moral incapacities have their source in reason itself.
The theory of knowledge of moral incapacity offered in this essay draws on
elements of Richard Moran's "deliberative" theory of self-knowledge and
elements of that theory are used to offer a theory of moral incapacities which
extends and improves on Bernard Williams' "deliberative" theory of moral
incapacities. The resulting theory is then defended against objections and
alternatives.

@Cox-Constitutivism

*Abstract:* This essay is about two familiar theses in the philosophy of
mind: *constitutivism about instrumental desires*, and *constitutivism about
introspective beliefs*, and the arguments for and against them. Constitutivism
about instrumental desire is the thesis that instrumental desires are at least
partly constituted by the desires and means-end beliefs which explain them and
is a thesis which has been championed most prominently by Michael Smith.
Constitutivism about introspective belief is the thesis that introspective
beliefs are at least partly constituted by the mental states they are about and
is a thesis which has been championed most prominently by Sydney Shoemaker.
Despite their similarities, the fortunes of these two theses could not be more
opposed: constitutivism about instrumental desire is widely accepted, and
constitutivism about introspective belief is widely rejected. Yet, the
arguments for both theses are roughly analogous. This essay explores these
arguments. I argue that the argument which is widely taken to be the best
argument for constitutivism about instrumental desires---what I call the
*argument from necessitation*---does not provide the support for the thesis it
is widely taken to provide, and that it fails for much the same reasons that it
fails to provide support for constitutivism about introspective belief and I
argue that the *best* argument for constitutivism about instrumental
desires---what I will call the *argument from cognitive dynamics*---is also a
*good* argument, if not an *equally good* argument, for constitutivism about
introspective belief (at least when the thesis is suitably qualified).

@Cox-Setiya

*Abstract:* It is widely held that agent-neutral consequentialism is
incompatible with deontic constraints. Recently, Kieran Setiya has challenged
this orthodoxy by presenting a form of agent-neutral consequentialism that he
claims can capture deontic constraints. In this reply, we argue against
Setiya's proposal by pointing to features of deontic constraints that his
account fails to capture.

@Cox-Brom

*Abstract:* Are why-interrogatives just like other wh-interrogatives,
syntactically speaking? Are they filler-gap constructions? This essay presents
the case for thinking that they are. It brings together the standard arguments
for thinking that they are and presents a new argument for thinking so. It
then critically examines the justly influential arguments of Sylvain
Bromberger for thinking that why-interrogatives are not syntactically just
like other wh-interrogatives and argues that they do not establish their
conclusion.

@Cox-Reflect

*Abstract:* While it is widely held that normative reflection is an effective
means of controlling our emotions, it has proven to be notoriously difficult
to provide a plausible model of such control. How could reflection on the
normative status of our emotions be a means of controlling them? Higher-order
models of reflective control give a special role to higher-order beliefs and
judgements about the normative status of our emotions in controlling our
emotions, but in doing so claim that higher-order beliefs and judgements have
more control over our emotional lives than they in fact have, and fail to
explain some of the central features of reflective control.  First-order
models of reflective control give a special role to first-order evaluative
beliefs and perceptions about the objects of our emotions in controlling our
emotions, but in doing so fail to explain how normative reflection could be a
distinctive means  of controlling our emotions at all. In this essay, I defend
a model of reflective control which avoids the twin pitfalls of the
higher-order and first-order models of reflective control, while learning from
them both. I defend a model according to which normative reflection is a
means of bringing our emotions under the control of reflective reason, where
an emotion's being under the control of reflective reason is to be understood
in terms of its being under the control of one's first-order evaluative
beliefs and perceptions in accordance with one's reflective commitments.

@Cox-HowWhy

*Abstract:* How do why-interrogatives work? How do they express the questions
they express, in the contexts in which they express them? In this essay, I
argue that, at a fundamental level, why-interrogatives work just like other
wh-interrogatives, particularly other adjunct wh-interrogatives, and they
express the questions they express, in the contexts in which they express them,
by the same means that other wh-interrogatives do. These conclusions go against
a trend in recent work on why-interrogatives, which holds that they are
syntactically and semantically unlike other wh-interrogatives. Since the claim
that why-interrogatives are unlike other wh-interrogatives has been taken to
support various philosophical theses about the nature of why-questions and
explanation, showing that why-interrogatives are just like other
wh-interrogatives undermines this line of support for these theses.

@Cox-KnowWhy

*Abstract:* In this essay, I argue that we have a non-inferential way of knowing
particular explanations of our own actions and attitudes. I begin by
explicating and evaluating Nisbett and Wilson's influential argument to
the contrary. I argue that Nisbett and Wilson's claim that we arrive at
such explanations of our own actions and attitudes by inference is not
adequately supported by their findings because they overlook an
important alternative explanation of those findings. I explicate and
defend such an alternative explanation of how we can know such
explanations in a non-inferential way, drawing on recent work in the
philosophy of self-knowledge.

@Cox-Threshold

*Abstract:* The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding the connection between the nature of democracy and the role of education in a democratic society. I begin by giving an account of the nature of democracy, along with an account of the conditions and substantive outcomes required to achieve and sustain a democratic society. I then examine the role education plays in securing these outcomes. From this understanding, and taking my cue from the work of Amy Gutmann, I argue that a democratic society is required to distribute educational resources according to what I call the Revised Democratic Threshold Principle. The account offered here provides broad requirements for the distribution of educational resources in a democratic society, along with a justification for these particular requirements in relation to the broader aspects of democratic theory. I finish by briefly examining ways in which the Revised Democratic Threshold Principle can fail to be met, and how this serves to undermine democratic decision-making.
