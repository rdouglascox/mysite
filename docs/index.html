<p>
  I'm a philosopher based at the University of Sydney in the Discipline of
  Philosophy in the School of Humanities.
</p>

<p>
  I am interested in a wide range of philosophical topics, but tend to think and
  write about issues in political philosophy, the philosophy of mind, and the
  philosophy of language.
</p>

<p>
  In political philosophy, I have published work on educational justice, the
  relationship between democracy and social equality, and on questions related
  to political legitimacy and Indigenous justice. In the philosophy of mind, I
  have published on our knowledge of our own minds and our knowledge of our own
  reasons for acting and holding particular attitudes. In the philosophy of
  language, I have published on the syntax and semantics of why-questions.
</p>

<p>
  I have several research projects underway at the moment. One on philosophical
  issues relating to educational justice; another on the nature of political
  legitimacy and its application to Indigenous issues; and another on the nature
  of first-person thought and, more broadly, the role of perspectival thought in
  the humanities.
</p>

<p>
  I regularly teach two units at the University of Sydney, PHIL2635 Contemporary
  Political Philosophy and the July Intensive iteration of PHIL1012 Introductory
  Logic. Starting Semester 2, 2025, I will be regularly teaching half of
  BPPE1000 Introduction to PPE.

  I am currently the convenor of the University of Sydney Philosophy Seminar
  Series for which I maintain the following
  <a href="https://rdouglascox.github.io/sydphilseminarseries/">website</a>.
  Contact me if you are a philosopher passing through Sydney and would like to
  present something in the seminar series.
</p>

<p>
  I live in Sydney with
  <a href="https://www.luaraferracioli.com">my partner</a> and our three
  children.
