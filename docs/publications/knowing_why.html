<p>In this essay, I argue that we have a non-inferential way of knowing
particular explanations of our own actions and attitudes. I begin by
explicating and evaluating Nisbett and Wilson’s influential argument to
the contrary. I argue that Nisbett and Wilson’s claim that we arrive at
such explanations of our own actions and attitudes by inference is not
adequately supported by their findings because they overlook an
important alternative explanation of those findings. I explicate and
defend such an alternative explanation of how we can know such
explanations in a non-inferential way, drawing on recent work in the
philosophy of self-knowledge.</p>
</div>
</header>
<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>An important subproblem of the problem of self-knowledge is that of
explaining how we know particular explanations of our own actions and
attitudes. We seem to know particular explanatory facts in a
non-inferential way, just as we seem to know particular non-explanatory
facts about our own actions and attitudes in a non-inferential way. I
seem to know, in a non-inferential way, for instance, that I am going to
the pub because Jane is there. And I seem to know, in a non-inferential
way, that I believe that Jane is at the pub because her car is in the
car park. If we know particular explanations of our own actions and
attitudes in a non-inferential way, then the problem of explaining how
we know them seems to be another subproblem of the problem of
self-knowledge.</p>
<p>One good reason for thinking that we know such explanations in a
non-inferential way is that we often know such explanations even though
we do not have good reasons for believing that they obtain. As Donald
Davidson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though you may, on rare occasions, accept public or private evidence
as showing that you are wrong about your reasons, you usually have no
evidence and make no observations. Then your knowledge of your own
reasons for your actions is not generally inductive, for where there is
induction, there is evidence. <span class="citation"
data-cites="DavidsonEAE">(Davidson 1980, 18)</span><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thought here is that in order for us to <em>know</em> particular
explanations of our own actions and attitudes by inference, our beliefs
would have to be based on sufficient reasons for so believing. But since
we do not seem to <em>have</em> sufficient reasons for so
believing—Davidson says we usually have <em>no</em> evidence or
reasons—our beliefs cannot be <em>based</em> on such reasons, and,
therefore, we do not <em>know</em> particular explanations of our own
actions and attitudes by inference.</p>
<p>However, many theorists deny that we know such explanations in a
non-inferential way. They are impressed by symmetries between the
explanations we give of our own actions and attitudes and the
explanations given by others. The symmetries, if they exist, are
impressive. One particular symmetry, which is the focus of the famous
studies of <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">Nisbett and Wilson (1977)</span>,
concerns the similarity between the explanations we give of our own
actions and attitudes and the explanations given by suitably placed
observers who must make inferences about the explanations of our actions
and attitudes on the basis of evidence that they have. It turns out that
we are prone to make very similar mistakes as the observers. This is a
good reason for thinking that we do not know such explanations in a way
which is radically different to how others know such explanations. And
it is a good reason, it seems, for thinking that we know such
explanations by inference. The thought here is that the best explanation
of the observed self and other symmetries is that both must be arriving
at their explanations by inference. Many theorists have been persuaded
by this simple argument and are happy to narrow the scope of the problem
of self-knowledge to that of explaining how we know particular
non-explanatory facts about our own actions and attitudes.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So, on the one hand, we seem to have good reasons for thinking that
we know particular explanations of our actions and attitudes in a
non-inferential way <em>and</em>, on the other hand, we seem to have
good reasons for thinking that we do not. We have a problem. How might
we respond? Perhaps we <em>do</em> have good reasons for believing that
particular explanation of our actions and attitudes obtain after all:
perhaps Davidson and those who follow him are wrong. Alternatively,
perhaps on closer examination we find that the self and other symmetry
evaporates: perhaps the empirical evidence is misleading. Or perhaps we
can make the claim that we know particular explanations of our actions
and attitudes in a non-inferential way consistent with the observed self
and other symmetry. That is, perhaps the self and other symmetries do
not support the inference hypothesis, as we might call it, over some
alternative non-inferential hypothesis.</p>
<p>In this essay I defend the third option. I begin by laying out
Nisbett and Wilson’s argument for the conclusion that we must know
particular explanations of our own actions and attitudes by inference
and then examine the experimental evidence their argument draws on. I
argue that, although the evidence is not entirely unproblematic, we
should tentatively accept it, and accept that there are certain
symmetries between self and other when it comes to explanations of our
own actions and attitudes. I then examine the reasons we have for
thinking that we know particular explanations of our own actions and
attitudes in a non-inferential way. At this point we are left with a
serious tension: we have what looks like a good argument for a
conclusion that we simply cannot accept, since we also have good reasons
for not believing that conclusion. What we need is an alternative
explanation of Nisbett and Wilson’s symmetry. In the final sections I
develop such an alternative according to which our knowledge of
particular explanations of our actions and attitudes is arrived at by
resolving particular deliberative questions about our reasons for our
actions and attitudes. I argue that this theory can explain the self and
other symmetry and the other features of our knowledge of explanations
of our actions and attitudes.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="the-argument-from-symmetry"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> The Argument from Symmetry</h1>
<p>In this section I examine Nisbett and Wilson’s influential argument
for the conclusion that we know particular explanations of our own
attitudes and actions by inference. Strikingly, although Nisbett and
Wilson’s essay is often cited in support of the claim that we know
particular explanations of our actions and attitudes by inference, the
particular arguments of the essay are rarely discussed in any detail. In
what follows I will carefully examine both the structure of the argument
and the support given for the crucial premises.</p>
<p>The starting point for Nisbett and Wilson’s argument is a particular
kind of self and other symmetry. The particular kind of self and other
symmetry which interested Nisbett and Wilson was a symmetry in kinds of
error and ignorance about particular explanations of actions and
attitudes between self and other. Nisbett and Wilson claimed on the
basis of their experimental studies that the kind of errors we make
about particular explanations of our <em>own</em> actions and attitudes
are just the same kind of errors someone else would make about
particular explanations of our actions and attitudes. They argued that
the best explanation of this symmetry is that we must be arriving at
explanations of our own actions and attitudes by inference, just like
others must. They assumed, plausibly, that others must arrive at
explanations of our actions and attitudes by inference. So a good
explanation of why we make the same kind of errors and have the same
kind of ignorance about explanations of our own actions and attitudes is
that we are arriving at our explanations by inference from roughly the
same evidence.</p>
<p>In developing this argument Nisbett and Wilson draw on a similar
argument made by Daryl Bem concerning our knowledge of our attitudes
<span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson bem_self_perception">(Nisbett and Wilson
1977, 248; Bem 1967)</span>. Bem had argued that subjects showed the
same kind of errors and ignorance about their own attitudes as suitably
placed observers. He inferred from this that the subjects must be
arriving at beliefs about their own attitudes by inference from roughly
the same evidence as observers. Bem’s argument, in the case of
ascriptions of certain attitudes is roughly the following: the
self-ascriptions of a actor subject of attitudes to herself, and the
ascriptions of an external observer with access to much the same
information as actor subject, are relevantly similar; the best
explanation of this is that the agent does not have a ‘fount of
privileged self-knowledge’, rather, the agent’s self-ascriptions of
attitudes ‘may be viewed as inferences from observations of his own
overt behavior and its accompanying stimulus variables’; so agents are
arriving at self-ascriptions by inference <span class="citation"
data-cites="bem_self_perception">(Bem 1967, 186)</span>. Bem goes on to
speak of the ‘…empirical generalization that an individual’s belief and
attitude statements and the beliefs and attitudes that an outside
observer would attribute to him are often functionally similar in that
both sets of statements are partial ’inferences’ from the same evidence
…’ <span class="citation" data-cites="bem_self_perception">(Bem 1967,
186)</span>. Here are Nisbett and Wilson making a perfectly analogous
argument in the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…whatever capacity for introspection exists, it does not produce
accurate reports about stimulus effects, nor does it even produce
reports that differ from predictions of observers operating only with a
verbal description of the stimulus situation…. [I]f the reports of
subjects do not differ from the reports of observers, then it is
unnecessary to assume that the former are drawing on ‘a font of
privileged knowledge’. It seems equally clear that subjects and
observers are drawing on a similar source for their verbal reports about
stimulus effects. <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">(Nisbett and Wilson 1977,
247–48)</span>, quoting from <span class="citation"
data-cites="bem_self_perception">(Bem 1967, 186)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the argument is an inference to the best explanation, it is
important to be clear about what the alternative explanations are.
Nisbett and Wilson assume that the only relevant alternative explanation
is one on which we know particular explanations of our own actions and
attitudes by <em>introspection</em>—on an observational model of
introspection. In the remainder of this section, I explicate the
introspection hypothesis and the inference hypothesis in detail, and
argue that the inference hypothesis provides a better explanation of the
symmetries than the inner-observation hypothesis.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="the-inner-observation-hypothesis"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Inner-Observation
Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Nisbett and Wilson do not offer an explicit technical definition of
introspection, but they do give us some hints about what they had in
mind. They speak of ‘direct introspective access’ and ‘direct
introspective awareness’ and speak of the potential ability of subjects
to ‘…observe directly the workings of their own minds’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">(Nisbett and Wilson
1977, 232)</span>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The latter suggests that they have
something like an observational or perceptual theory of introspection in
mind which involves a kind of inner observation or perception. They seem
to have had in mind a picture on which our knowledge of particular
explanations of our own actions and attitudes involved a kind of inner
awareness of the particular mental processes relevant to such
explanations. This is suggested by the following question they ask early
in the essay: ‘If it is not direct introspective access to a memory of
the process involved, what is the source of such verbal reports?’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">(Nisbett and Wilson
1977, 232)</span>. And it is suggested again later in the essay when
they answer this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We propose that when people are asked to report how a particular
stimulus influenced a particular response, they do so not by consulting
a memory of the mediating process, but by applying or generating causal
theories about the effects of that type of stimulus on that type of
response. <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">(Nisbett and Wilson 1977,
248)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Nisbett and Wilson seem to have an observational model of
introspection in mind, one on which we are directly introspectively
aware of the mental processes relevant to explanations of our actions
and attitudes.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Let’s call the alternative
hypothesis, then, the inner-observation hypothesis. There are many ways
one can develop such an account of introspection. For now we can simply
assume that the process is some kind of perception-like process by which
one becomes aware of one’s mental processes, where this involves, at a
minimum, some kind of direct causal process by which one becomes aware
of one’s own mental processes <span class="citation"
data-cites="goldman2006simulating">(Goldman 2006, 246)</span>.
Importantly, nothing about the inner-observation model predicts that
introspection will be particularly reliable or error free.</p>
<p>It may seem striking that Nisbett and Wilson consider a kind of
inner-observation model of introspection as an alternative model of how
we know particular explanations of our own actions and attitudes.
According to Alvin Goldman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No careful privileged-access theorist should claim that people have
introspective access to the causes of their behavior, especially qua
causes, or to the cognitive processes that run their mental lives. <span
class="citation" data-cites="goldman2006simulating">(Goldman 2006,
233)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This awareness-of-causes thesis, however, is one that no classical
introspectionist, to my knowledge, has ever asserted. <span
class="citation"
data-cites="goldman_the_psychology_of_folk_psychology">(Goldman 1993,
27)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goldman and others think that the implausibility of an
inner-observation model of introspection as applied to knowledge of
particular explanations of our own actions and attitudes can be
established <em>a priori</em>. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we have known since Hume (1748), causal connections between events
cannot be directly observed; nor can they be introspected. A sensible
form of introspectionism, therefore, would not claim that people have
introspective access to causal connections, but this leaves it open that
they do have introspective access to the mere occurrence of certain
types of mental events. <span class="citation"
data-cites="goldman_the_psychology_of_folk_psychology">(Goldman 1993,
27)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the inner-observation model of introspection holds that we know
particular explanatory facts about our own actions and attitudes by a
kind of inner-perception, and it is impossible to know such facts by
inner-perception, then the model is implausible.</p>
<p>But it isn’t at all obvious that we cannot know causal facts by sense
perception <span class="citation"
data-cites="Beebee:2003aa Siegel:2010aa">(c.f. Beebee 2003; Siegel
2010)</span> and it isn’t at all obvious that the kind of particular
explanatory facts about our own actions and attitudes are
<em>ordinary</em> causal facts <span class="citation"
data-cites="AnscombeI">(c.f. Anscombe 1963)</span>. Moreover, Nisbett
and Wilson do not say that the inner-observation model of introspection
is committed to the claim that we can know particular explanatory facts
about our own actions and attitudes <em>directly</em> by inner
observation. Rather, they seem to think that what we know by a kind of
inner-observation is that some higher-order cognitive process has taken
place and from this we arrive at beliefs about explanations. If there is
a criticism of Nisbett and Wilson lurking here it is that they do not
say how they think that knowledge of such cognitive processes connects
with knowledge of particular explanations of our actions and attitudes.
But it is hard to see that this amounts to much of a criticism.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="the-inference-hypothesis"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Inference Hypothesis</h2>
<p>The alternative to the introspection hypothesis, and the hypothesis
that Nisbett and Wilson ultimately defend, is the inference hypothesis.
According to the inference hypothesis, we know particular explanations
of our actions and attitudes by inference. Nisbett and Wilson similarly
do not offer a technical definition of inference, but we can assume that
they intend their conclusion to be about the ordinary notion of
inference.</p>
<p>According to the the ordinary notion of inference, inferring is a
kind of mental process, and in the first instance, one infers one fact
or facts from another fact or set of facts. I might, for instance, infer
that John is home from the fact that his lights are on. I infer one
fact, namely, the fact that John is home, from another fact, namely, the
fact that his lights are on. But if I infer that John is home from the
fact that his lights are on, I can also be said to infer—in a distinct
but related sense—that John is home from my <em>belief</em> that he is
home. In general, it seems that one can infer some fact from another
fact only if one infers the former fact from a belief whose content
corresponds to the latter fact. The converse doesn’t hold, however. I
might infer that John is home from my belief that his lights are on
without, thereby, having inferred that John is home from the fact that
his lights are on, since his lights might not be on. The important point
for now is that according to the ordinary notion of inference, one can
infer something from some fact only if one infers it from a belief whose
content corresponds to that fact. When we do, we can say that one belief
is psychologically based on the other.</p>
<p>It is also part of our ordinary notion of inference that in order to
<em>know</em> something by inference, one must infer that thing from
<em>sufficient</em> reasons for believing it. In order for me to know
that John is home by inference I must infer that he is home from
sufficient reasons for believing it. If I infer that he is home from the
fact that his lights are on, among other facts, then I may well count as
having inferred that he is home from sufficient reasons.</p>
<p>These truisms about inference will be relevant later, for one can, of
course, respond to some of the difficulties I raise for Nisbett and
Wilson by arguing that we know explanations of our actions and attitudes
by inference on a different conception of inference, one which departs
either psychologically, or epistemologically, or in both ways, from the
ordinary notion.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3"
id="why-the-symmetries-support-the-inference-hypothesis"><span
class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Why the Symmetries Support the
Inference Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Understood this way, it is clear that the inference hypothesis
provides a better explanation of symmetries between self and other, than
the introspection hypothesis. The introspection hypothesis provides no
explanation at all of the symmetries between self and other. Why should
we expect such symmetries if we know particular explanations of our own
actions and attitudes by introspection thus conceived? We should expect
asymmetries. Notice that the point here is not just that we are
sometimes mistaken about the explanations of our own actions and
attitudes. That wouldn’t count against the inner-observation hypothesis.
It is the kind of mistake which counts.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is difficult to see why we should expect such symmetries
between self and other on any hypothesis other than the inferential
hypothesis. The process by which we arrive at explanations of our own
actions and attitudes <em>must</em> be sensitive to the same kind of
things that the explanations of our own actions and attitudes of a
suitably placed observer if the symmetry in the pattern of errors and
ignorance between self and other is not to be a miracle. So it doesn’t
matter too much that Nisbett and Wilson were vague about alternative
hypotheses. Any hypothesis in the vicinity of the observational model of
introspection is going to fail to offer a process which is sensitive to
the same kind of things as the observer’s process.</p>
<p>It will be helpful at this point to lay out Nisbett and Wilson’s
argument explicitly. We can think of their argument as having roughly
the following form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Major Empirical Premise</em>: Typically, the beliefs of actor
subjects about rational explanations of the actions and mental states of
actor subjects are false if, and only if, the beliefs of observer

<p>So it seems that <em>if</em> Nisbett and Wilson are right, and the
symmetries exists, and the only potential explanations of the symmetries
are the introspection hypothesis and the inference hypothesis, then the
the conclusion that we know particular explanations of our actions and
attitudes is well supported: it is the best explanation of the
symmetries. For the remainder of the essay, I will evaluate this
argument. In the next section I will look at the support for the major
empirical premise of the argument. In the final sections of the essay I
am going to argue, however, that the plausibility of the argument is
undermined once we see that there is a viable alternative
non-inferential explanation of the symmetries available.<a href="#fn5"

<h1 data-number="3" id="the-evidence-for-symmetry"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> The Evidence for Symmetry</h1>
<p>Nisbett and Wilson attempt to establish experimentally that there are
particular <em>symmetries</em> between self and other when it comes to
explanations of actions and attitudes. Those symmetries involve
particular patterns of error and ignorance about the explanation of an
agent’s actions and attitudes. They write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…the evidence suggests that people’s erroneous reports about their
cognitive processes are not capricious or haphazard, but instead are
regular and systematic. Evidence for this comes from the fact that
‘observer’ subjects, who did not participate in the experiments but who
simply read verbal descriptions of them, made predictions about the
stimuli which were remarkably similar to the reports about the stimuli
by subjects who had actually been exposed to them. <span
class="citation" data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">(Nisbett and Wilson
1977, 247)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The experimental setup by which Nisbett and Wilson sought to
establish this was simple. Nisbett and Wilson had ‘actor-subjects’ make
particular choices, decisions, and evaluations, and then asked those
subjects why they made the choices, decisions, and evaluations, that
they did. Nisbett and Wilson had so-called ‘observer-subjects’—who were
given information about the actor subject, their situation, and their
choice—explain the actor subject’s choice, decision, or evaluation.</p>
<p>What Nisbett and Wilson claim to have found is no significant
difference in the explanations given by actor subjects and observer
subjects regarding the actor subject’s choice, decision, or evaluation.
When actor subjects were in error about a particular explanation, so too
were the observer subjects, and vice versa. When actor subjects were
ignorant of a particular explanation, so too were the observer subjects,
and vice versa. In short ‘…subject reports were accurate if and only if
observer predictions were also accurate’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows 1977, 622)</span>.
From this Nisbett and Wilson inferred that actor subjects must be
arriving at explanations of their own actions and attitudes by
inference. Here is how Nisbett and Nancy Bellows put it: ‘The similarity
of subject reports about the effects of the factors and observer
predictions about their effects was so great as to indicate that they
must have been generated by similar processes, that is, by reliance on
similar a priori causal theories’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows 1977,
622)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly review several of the studies from which Nisbett and
Wilson draw this conclusion. In one study, which we can call the
emotional impact of literature study, subjects were presented with a
passage of literature in which an innocent child is drowned and then
asked about the emotional impact particular parts of the passage had had
on them <span class="citation" data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">(Nisbett
and Wilson 1977, 245)</span>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Nisbett and Wilson had
found that the absence or presence of particular parts of the passage
typically had no effect on the emotional impact of the passage or the
reported emotional impact of the passage. However, subjects reported
that the relevant parts of the passage increased the emotional impact of
the passage. So actor subjects seemed to be in error about the
explanation of their responses.</p>
<p>Nisbett and Wilson also presented the relevant passages to subjects
who did not originally receive them and asked these subjects to predict
what the emotional impact of these passages <em>would have been</em>,
had they been presented with them originally. In other words, Nisbett
and Wilson had observer subjects give explanations of the actor
subjects’ emotional response. Strikingly, the answers given by the
observer subjects were basically the same as those of the subjects who
were originally presented with the passages <span class="citation"
data-cites="Wilson:1978aa">(Wilson and Nisbett 1978, 126)</span>. The
observer subjects seem to make a similar error, since it is plausible to
assume that the observer subjects would not themselves have had such
responses themselves.</p>
<p>In another study, which we can call the reassurance and willingness
study, subjects were reassured that the electric shocks they were
receiving were not doing them permanent damage, and then given
increasingly higher shocks <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_wilson">(Nisbett and Wilson 1977, 246)</span>.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Nisbett and Wilson claim that
whether subjects receive reassurances or not does not make a difference
to how far the subjects went in taking shocks. Subjects were then asked
whether the fact that they received the reassurance explained why they
had gone as far as they had. Subjects typically believed that it did. So
subjects seem to be in error about an explanation of their action.</p>
<p>Nisbett and Wilson report that observer subjects who were merely
asked to predict whether the reassurance would make a difference to how
much shock a subject would take and whether it would increase their
shock, made basically the same predictions: ‘…control subjects’
predictions about the effects of inclusion of the phrase were similar to
the incorrect reports of experimental subjects. Half believed the phrase
would have had an effect and of these, two thirds believed the phrase
would have increased their willingness to take shocks’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="Wilson:1978aa">(Wilson and Nisbett 1978,
128)</span>. The observer subjects too seemed to be in error. These
subjects would offer explanations of the actions of actor subjects which
did not in fact obtain.</p>
<p>In the above studies the inclusion of an observer subject was
something of an afterthought. In another study, however, Nisbett and
Bellows set out explicitly to establish the symmetry between self and
other concerning explanations of attitudes and actions <span

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Nisbett and Bellows’ study used female college students and concerned
the reasons for which they made certain judgements. The subjects were
given information about a similarly aged, female, job candidate and were
asked to make certain judgements about the candidate. Different groups
of subjects were given slightly different information about the
candidate. Half were told the candidate was attractive and the other
half were not, a different half were told that she had an excellent
academic record and the other half were not, a different half again were
told that the candidate had spilt coffee at the interview and the other
half were not, a different half again were told that the candidate had
been involved in an auto accident and the other half were not, and a
different half again were told that they would have an opportunity to
meet the candidate and the other half were not <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows 1977,
615)</span>.</p>
<p>The judgements the subjects were asked to make were in answer to the
following questions: (1) How much do you think you would like this
person?; (2) How sympathetic would this person be to the feelings of
others?; (3) How intelligent do you think this person is?; (4) How
flexible would the person be in solving problems? The subjects were then
asked to answer questions concerning ‘how certain factors influenced
their judgements’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows 1977, 618)</span>.
They were then asked questions like: ‘How did the person’s academic
credentials influence your judgement of how intelligent the person is?’
Such questions can be seen as asking whether facts about the person’s
academic credentials, say, were among the reasons why the agent made the
judgement she did about the intelligence of the person.</p>
<p>Another group of female students, the so-called ‘observer subjects’
were ‘told that the investigators were interested in how people make
judgements about others from particular kinds of information’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows
1977, 618)</span>. These subjects were not given any general information
about the candidate, but were told to imagine that the candidate is of
the same age and sex as themselves. Observers were then asked to
‘suppose you knew the person was quite physically attractive’, for
example, and then asked questions like ‘How would that influence how
much you like the person?’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows 1977, 618)</span>.
Nisbett and Bellows predicted that (i) subject reports would be accurate
concerning the influence of information about academic performance on
their judgements of intelligence, but inaccurate with respect to the
influence of information about meeting the candidate on their judgements
of likability; (ii) the accuracy of subject reports would not exceed the
accuracy of observer predictions; and (iii) observer predictions would
be highly similar to actor reports. Here is Nisbett and Bellows’ report
of what they found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject accuracy did not exceed observer accuracy for any of the
judgements. For the more subjective judgements, the accuracy of subject
reports was nil and so was the accuracy of observer predictions. For the
intelligence judgement, subject accuracy was virtually perfect. This
accuracy cannot be attributed to introspective capacity on the part of
the subjects, however, because the accuracy of observer predictions
equalled the accuracy of subject reports. The correlation between
observer predictions and actual effects (.98) was trivially higher than
the correlation between subject reports and actual effects (.94). Thus
subject reports were accurate if and only if observer predictions were
also accurate. <span class="citation"
data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows 1977,
621–22)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This evidence certainly seems to support the self and other symmetry.
If these experimental results generalise, then it certainly looks like
‘[subjects’] explanations about the causes of their response are no more
accurate than the explanations of a complete stranger who lives in the
same culture’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="wilson_strangers">(Wilson 2002, 108–9)</span>. At this point
there are two ways of responding to the argument. We can either question
the evidence for the major empirical premise of the argument, or we can
question the inference itself. For the remainder of this section I
examine objections to the major empirical premise. For the remaining
sections of the essay I examine the inference, arguing that it overlooks
an alternative explanation of the symmetry.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="problems-with-the-evidence-for-symmetry"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Problems With the Evidence for
Symmetry</h2>
<p>It is on the basis of studies like these that Nisbett and Wilson take
themselves to have established that there is a particular kind of
<em>symmetry</em> between self and other when it comes to explanations
of actions and attitudes. There are many questions that we can and
should ask about these studies. Indeed, many such questions have been
asked.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Two particular concerns stand
out.</p>
<p>One issue is the following. So far the symmetry claim has been
presented as the claim that for any particular explanation which obtains
or does not obtain, individual actor subjects are just as likely to be
in error about that particular explanation as individual observer
subjects. Of course, in order to directly test a claim like this, one
would need a way of knowing when an explanation obtains and when one
doesn’t, and one would need a way of knowing what the subject believes
about explanations. It is notoriously difficult to know whether an
explanation obtains in any particular case.</p>
<p>It turns out that Nisbett and Wilson did not directly test this
claim, however. Rather, they tested the claim that for any particular
explanation of the average response of the actor subjects, taken
together, the average response of actor subjects, taken together, is
just as likely to be erroneous, as the average response of observer
subjects, taken together. For instance, in the reassurance and
willingness study, receiving a reassurance about the shock did not have
an influence on the <em>average</em> willingness to take shocks. But, on
average, both actor subjects and observer subjects believed that the
actor subjects went as far as they did in taking shocks because they
received the relevant reassurance.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The obvious problem with this kind of between-subject design is that
it is compatible with the reassurance having no influence on the actor
subjects. It is compatible with the fact, say, that half of the actor
subjects <em>were</em> influenced by the reassurance, and half were not.
And it is compatible with the average of the actor subjects’ reports
being that there was an influence, with, say, the half of the subjects
who <em>were</em> influenced by the reassurance, reporting that they
were, and the half of the subject who were not influenced by the
reassurance, reporting that they were not.</p>
<p>As Nisbett and Ross write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The between-subject design of the study make it impossible to assess
the accuracy of the individual subjects’ causal reports. It could be
that, despite the failure of subjects as a group to distinguish between
effective and ineffective manipulations, particular subjects may have
reported accurately the influences on their own judgements. <span
class="citation" data-cites="Nisbett:1980aa">(Nisbett and Ross 1980,
215)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several critics of Nisbett and Wilson have drawn attention to this
<span class="citation"
data-cites="Smith:1978aa White:1980aa Wright:1981aa">(Smith and Miller
1978; White 1980, 109–10; Wright and Rip 1981, 602)</span>.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> But the mere compatibility between
the average response and answer with the lack of error on the actor
subject’s part, does not show much. This is just an alternative
hypothesis. Surely the <em>best</em> explanation of the symmetry that
Nisbett and Wilson did directly test is that for any particular
explanation which obtains or does not obtain, individual actor subjects
are just as likely to be in error about that particular explanation as
individual observer subjects.</p>
<p>Another concern about Nisbett and Wilson’s studies is more pressing.
This concern is that Nisbett and Wilson do not carefully distinguish
between different <em>kinds</em> of explanations of our actions and
attitudes <span class="citation"
data-cites="Smith:1978aa white_knowing_more">(Smith and Miller 1978,
357; White 1988, 21)</span>. Nobody thinks that we are able to know
<em>all</em> kinds of explanations of our actions and attitudes in a
non-inferential way. Our actions and attitudes have ever so many
different kinds of explanations. They have historical, neurological, and
micro-physical explanations, but we cannot know <em>these</em>
explanations non-inferentially, and nobody claims that we can. Rather,
what is at issue is whether we can know what we might call <em>rational
explanations</em> of our actions and attitudes, which include what we
might call <em>reason explanations</em>—explanations whose explanantia
are the agent’s reasons for her action or attitude—and <em>psychological
explanations</em>—explanations whose explanantia are psychological
states which rationalize the agent’s actions or attitude <span
class="citation" data-cites="AlvarezKR">(Alvarez 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem that Nisbett and Wilson are insensitive to these
distinctions. To some extent that is so. Nisbett and Wilson seem to be
interested in both <em>merely psychological explanations</em>, which
aren’t necessarily a kind of rational explanation, and <em>psychological
explanations proper</em>, which are a kind of rational explanation.<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Recall the job applicant study.
Nisbett and Wilson found that a subject’s belief that she was about to
meet a particular job applicant explained her evaluation of the
applicant’s likeability. Subjects denied that this was so. So they
seemed to be in error. But, arguably, they are not in error if what they
are denying is that a particular <em>rational</em> explanation obtains
with this belief as its explanans. They may well be right about this
although a merely psychological explanation may obtain.</p>
<p>In light of this, one might argue that once we exclude ignorance and
error of merely psychological explanations and merely causal
explanations from the data, we will no longer find a symmetry between
self and other. An objection of this kind has been put forcefully by
Constantine Sandis. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A worry with [Nisbett and Wilson’s] analysis is its lack of any
distinction between the causes of bodily behavior and agential reasons
for acting. Ironically, their argument unintentionally suggests that
laypeople might be making just such a distinction. If so they would be
right to do so: the position of a pair of stockings on a table is
rarely, if ever, a reason for which one chooses them over another pair.
It could, however, explain why we mistakenly come to think of them as
being smoother etc. What we are fabricating in such a case is not a tale
about our agential reasons but one about the quality of the stockings
<span class="citation" data-cites="Sandis:2015aa">(Sandis 2015,
270)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have some sympathy with this objection. But Sandis has cherrypicked
his case. Perhaps Nisbett and Wilson miscategorise this case. But we can
reexamine the studies with this distinction in mind and see whether
their experiments do show the relevant pattern of errors in the case of
<em>rational</em> explanation. If we look carefully at Nisbett and
Wilson’s studies, we see that in many cases the explanations involved
<em>are</em> rational explanations, and that there is symmetry between
self and other with respect to such explanations. For example, it is
very plausible that in the job applicant study, particular rational
explanations obtain which the subjects deny obtain and that the
explanations the subjects claim obtain do not obtain.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that Nisbett and Wilson’s studies are
unproblematic. I think it would be a mistake, however, to dismiss them
out of hand, and optimistically hope that future research will not
establish a symmetry between self and other with respect to such
explanations. Indeed, there is evidence from split-brain studies, and
choice-blindness studies, which suggest that subjects will explain
choices that they did not make, in something like the way the subjects
in these experiments offer explanations for responses which have
alternative psychological explanations <span class="citation"

href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> I suggest that we do not leave our
evaluation of Nisbett and Wilson’s argument open to empirical hostage in
this way. So I propose to tentatively accept that Nisbett and Wilson
have established that there is a kind of symmetry between self and other
when it comes to rational explanations of our actions and attitudes. My
strategy will be to argue that even if we grant Nisbett and Wilson this
assumption, we should not accept their conclusion. That is, we should
not accept that our knowledge of particular explanations of our own
actions and attitudes is inferential.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="against-inference"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Against The Inference
Hypothesis</h1>
<p>Before turning to an alternative explanation of the self and other
symmetry, I want to examine the case for thinking we know explanations
of our own actions and attitudes non-inferential in more detail. This
will put more pressure on us to find an alternative explanation which
reconciles the appearances, and the particular observation we will make
will point us towards a particular alternative explanation of the
appearances.</p>
<p>Strikingly, Nisbett and Wilson seem to think that the only reasons
<em>against</em> the hypothesis that our knowledge of such explanations
is inferential is that it does not <em>feel</em> to us like we are
making an inference when we arrive at such explanations. They attempt to
provide an alternative explanation of this fact. But this isn’t the only
reason for thinking that our knowledge of such explanations is
non-inferential. As we saw above, the fact that we often simply do not
have adequate reasons for believing that such explanations obtain is a
good reason for thinking that we do not know such explanations by
inference.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> This was Davidson’s point. But
there are further reasons for thinking that we do not arrive at such
knowledge by inference. In this section I isolate some of these
reasons.</p>
<p>It is helpful at this point to remind ourselves of the features of
our ordinary notion of inference which we isolated above. The two
central features were that if we infer something from some fact we infer
it from a belief whose content corresponds to that fact and that in
order to know something by inference we must infer it from sufficient
reasons for believing it. There are good reasons for thinking that our
knowledge of particular explanations of our own actions and attitudes is
not arrived at by inference in this sense. We don’t infer it from other
things we believe, and we simply do not seem to have sufficient reasons
for believing such explanations. Of course, one might reject the
ordinary notion of inference. But that is to change the subject. The
question is whether such knowledge of particular explanations of our
actions and attitudes is non-inferential on the ordinary notion of
inference, for that is how Nisbett and Wilson’s conclusion is usually
understood.</p>
<p>If we arrive at knowledge of particular explanations of our actions
and attitudes, then we must infer those explanations from sufficient
reasons for believing that the explanations obtain. But our explanations
do not seem to be based on sufficient reasons, because we do not seem to
have sufficient reasons for believing such explanations. This is
Davidson’s point when he writes: ‘your knowledge of your own reasons for
your actions is not generally inductive, for where there is induction,
there is evidence’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="DavidsonEAE">(Davidson 1980, 18)</span>. Suppose I am
waiting in my office because I am expecting a phone call. I might know
that I am waiting in my office and that I am expecting a phone call. But
these facts, taken together, do not initially seem to be sufficient
reasons for believing that I am waiting in my office because I am
expecting a phone call. They might be good enough reasons for
<em>suspecting</em> that this is why I am waiting in my office, but not
for <em>believing</em> it. So I can’t <em>know</em> that I am waiting in
my office because I am expecting a phone call on the basis of such
reasons.</p>
<p>Moreover, when I know that I am going to the pub because Jane is
there, I may not know that I am <em>aware</em> that Jane is there at
all. Rather, my thoughts are directed entirely at the world, to facts
like the fact that Jane is at the pub. It would be quite a leap to infer
from the fact that I am going to the pub and the fact that Jane is at
the pub that I am going to the pub because Jane is there. A crucial
premise is missing, namely, the premise that I am aware that Jane is at
the pub. And finally, we often find out <em>why</em> we are doing what
we are doing at the same time that we find out <em>that</em> we are
doing it. In coming to know <em>that</em> I am waiting in my office, I
will come to know <em>why</em> I am waiting in my office. Not always,
but typically. So I come to know the proposition that I am waiting in my
office because I am expecting a phone call, without previously knowing
that I am waiting in my office. But I do not have sufficient evidence
for the hypothesis that I am waiting in my office because I am expecting
a phone call if I do not know that I am waiting in my office. A crucial
piece of evidence is not in place until <em>after</em> I come to know
why I am waiting in my office.</p>
<p>So we do not seem to have sufficient reasons for believing particular
explanations about our own actions and attitudes, at least
<em>prior</em> to knowing those explanations. There is a further and
related consideration that suggests that we are not making an inference
anyway. The point is that when we do explicitly consider the question of
why we are doing what we are doing or think what we think, we do not
consider facts which are reasons for and against believing some
particular explanation or another of our action or attitude. Rather, we
consider facts which are reasons for and against the action or the
attitude itself. As Wittgenstein writes: ‘Asked: ’Are you going to do
such-and-such’? I consider grounds for and against’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="Wittgenstein:1980aa">(Wittgenstein 1980,
vol. 1, sec. 815)</span>. And, as Stuart Hampshire writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I am asked, ‘What do you intend to do?,’ and if I were at all
uncertain about the answer, I would normally consider reasons for acting
in one way rather than another; that is, I would consider the merits of
the various courses of action open to me. If I am asked ‘What do you
believe?,’ and if I were at all uncertain about the answer, I would
normally consider the evidence in support of one proposition rather than
another. <span class="citation" data-cites="Hampshire:1975aa">(Hampshire
1975, 59)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not something we would expect if we were arriving at
knowledge of particular explanations of our actions and attitudes by
inference. When I explicitly consider the question of whether there is
life on Mars I consider reasons for and against believing that there is
life on Mars. When I consider the question of whether I <em>believe</em>
that there is life on Mars, I do <em>not</em> consider reasons for or
against believing that I <em>believe</em> that there is life on Mars. I
either consider no reasons at all, or I consider reasons for or against
believing that there is life on Mars. Much has been made of this kind of
observation in recent philosophical work <span class="citation"
data-cites="EvansVOR Gallois1996GALTWW MoranAE ByrneI fernandez_transparent_minds">(Evans

href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Of course, one might argue that
sometimes, in order to know what I believe, I first have to work out
what to believe, and so will consider reasons for and against believing
the thing in question before inferring that I believe it. But then we
should expect one to consider reasons for and against believing that one
believes the thing in question just after considering reasons for and
against believing the thing in question. But this is not what we
find.</p>
<p>So there are good reasons for thinking that, typically, we do not
know particular explanations of our actions and attitudes by inference,
contrary to the inferential hypothesis. It is the existence of
considerations like these which make the inferential hypothesis so hard
to believe. And it is considerations like these which motivate theorists
like Davidson to claim that such knowledge is not inferential. Of
course, the considerations are not decisive. But Nisbett and Wilson do
nothing to show that the inferential hypothesis can explain them or is
consistent with them.</p>
<p>At this point, then, we face a serious tension between the argument
from symmetry and these considerations. Perhaps we should reconsider
tentatively accepting the evidence for symmetry itself. But doing so on
the basis of considerations like these would be a rather immodest
application of common sense against empirical science. Perhaps we should
reconsider the assumption, which we have tacitly accepted throughout,
that observer subjects are arriving at explanations of the actions and
attitudes of actor subjects by inference.<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
Perhaps, however, there is an alternative, and better, explanation of
symmetry on which our knowledge is non-inferential, and has the features
discussed in the previous section. That’s what I am going to suggest in
the next section.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="an-alternative-explanation"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> An Alternative Explanation</h1>
<p>As we have seen, much of the plausibility of Nisbett and Wilson’s
argument derives from the assumption that there are only two relevant
alternative hypotheses concerning how we know particular explanations of
our own actions and attitudes: the inner-observation hypothesis and the
inferential hypothesis. In this section I want to introduce an
alternative explanation of how we know particular explanations of our
own actions and attitudes. In recent years, a kind of theory of
self-knowledge has emerged as a rival to both inferential and
inner-observation theories of self-knowledge. We can call this kind of
theory an interrogative theory of self-knowledge, for reasons which will
become apparent in a moment. In this section, I sketch such an
interrogative theory of self-knowledge and offer some initial motivation
for it. I will then argue that it offers an alternative explanation of
the self and other symmetry.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"

our own actions and attitudes. For example, an interrogative theory of
introspection might hold that you can come to know whether you will go
to the party by resolving the question of whether to go to the
party.</p>
<p>Several contemporary theories of self-knowledge can be thought of as
interrogative theories of self-knowledge, although they are not thought
of in such terms by their proponents.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
All interrogative theories have the basic idea above in common, however
they differ in their details. According to the interrogative theory
which I think is most promising, we can come to know the answers to
particular <em>theoretical</em> questions about our own attitudes and
actions by resolving distinct but related <em>deliberative</em>
questions about our own attitudes.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> According to this
theory, I can come to know whether I believe that Jane smokes—the answer
to a theoretical question—by resolving the question of whether to
believe that Jane smokes—a deliberative question. The relevant
alternative interrogative theories hold that I can come to know whether
I believe that Jane smokes by resolving the question of whether Jane
smokes—a theoretical question—or by resolving the question of whether I
should believe that Jane smokes—a normative question. On the face of it,
these are distinct views, since the questions of whether to believe that
Jane smokes, whether Jane smokes, and whether I should believe that Jane
smokes, are distinct.</p>
<p>Henceforth I will simply speak of the interrogative theory of
introspection, and mean by this a theory which holds that we can come to
know the answer to particular theoretical questions about our own
attitudes and actions by resolving distinct but related deliberative
questions about our own attitudes and actions.</p>
<p>According to the interrogative theory of introspection you can
resolve a theoretical question about your own actions and attitudes
merely by resolving a distinct but related deliberative question about
your actions and attitudes. Resolving a question here should be thought
of as a psychological process of some kind. Resolving a theoretical
question may simply be a matter of coming to believe a particular answer
to that question. Resolving some deliberative questions—for example, the
deliberative question of whether to go to the party—may simply be a
matter of forming an intention or making a decision. According to the
interrogative theory you can resolve a theoretical question about your
actions and attitudes merely by resolving a deliberative question about
your actions and attitudes. This is what makes the interrogative theory
a non-inferential theory. In order to resolve a theoretical question by
resolving a deliberative question you needn’t make an inference of any
kind. Most importantly, you do not first resolve the deliberative
question and then infer some answer to the relevant theoretical question
from the fact that you have resolved the deliberative question.</p>
<p>Those are the basic elements of the interrogative theory of
self-knowledge. The theory is perhaps most naturally applied in the case
of knowledge of future action. You might come to know that you will go
to the party by resolving the deliberative question of whether to go to
the party. You might resolve the question of whether you will go to the
party merely by resolving the question of whether to go to the party.
This has seemed to many to be a natural theory of how we can come to
know facts about our own future actions <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hampshire:1958aa Hampshire:1975aa">(c.f. Hampshire and Hart
1958; Hampshire 1975)</span>. Indeed, the interrogative theory is
well-placed to explain the observations from the previous section, since
it predicts that in coming to know whether you will go to the party, you
will consider reasons for and against going to the party, not reasons
for and against believing that you will go to the party. This is because
resolving the question of whether to go to the party will often involve
considering reasons for and against going to the party. And, moreover,
not only will you not consider reasons for and against believing that
you will go to the party, such reasons are entirely unnecessary. You can
resolve the question of whether to go to the party without having good
reasons for believing that you will go to the party.</p>
<p>Many theorists have thought that a similar theory can be offered in
the case of knowledge of our attitudes <span class="citation"
data-cites="EvansVOR MoranAE MoranSKTFA">(Evans 1982; Moran 2001,
2012)</span>. You might come to know that you believe that Jane is at
the party by resolving the question of whether to believe that Jane is
at the party. You can resolve the <em>theoretical</em> question of
whether you believe that Jane is at the party by resolving the
<em>deliberative</em> question of whether to believe that Jane is at the
party. And you might resolve the deliberative question of whether to
believe that Jane is at the party, in turn, by simply resolving the
theoretical question of whether Jane is at the party.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
The interrogative theory is well placed to explain the observations from
the previous section, since it predicts that in coming to know whether
you believe that Jane is at the party, you will consider reasons for and
against believing that Jane is at the party, and not reasons for and
against believing that that you believe that Jane is at the party.
Moreover, not only will you not consider reasons for and against
believing that you believe that Jane is at the party, such reasons are
entirely unnecessary. You can resolve the question of whether to believe
that Jane is at the party without having good reasons for believing that
you believe that Jane is at the party.</p>
<p>A natural question arises at this point as to whether you can come to
<em>know</em> that you will go to the party or come to know that you
believe that Jane is at the party in this way. But since there is a
strong presumption that we typically do know these things, then any
theory of how we are arriving at the relevant beliefs is a theory of how
we can come to know these things.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> To challenge the
presumption that we know these things by arguing that we can only know
such things by inference from good reasons is to beg the question
against any non-inferential theory.</p>
<p>Now I think that one serious motivation for the interrogative theory
(at least the version that we are considering here) is the ease with
which it can be extended to give an account of how we know particular
explanatory facts about our own actions and attitudes. According to the
interrogative theory, we can come to know particular explanatory facts
about our own actions and attitudes by resolving distinct but related
deliberative questions about our actions and attitudes. The question we
face is: which deliberative questions? I want to suggest that we can
come to know particular explanations of our own actions and attitude by
resolving the deliberative question of whether to treat some fact (or,
more generally, some consideration) as a reason for performing that
action or having that attitude. For example, according to this theory, I
can come to know whether I will go to the party because Jane is there by
resolving the deliberative question of whether to treat the fact that
Jane is at the party as a reason to go to the party. The fact that Jane
is at the party is a reason for me to go to the party, but it is a
further matter as to whether I treat it as a reason to go to the
party.</p>
<p>That is the suggestion. It is a natural extension of the
interrogative theory of self-knowledge as I have developed it here.
Indeed, the interrogative theory seems to require such an extension.
Resolving the question of whether to go to the party, for example,
involves not only considering reasons for and against going to the
party, but resolving the question of whether to treat those reasons as
reasons for or against going to the party. The fact that Jane is at the
party might be a reason for me to go to the party, and the fact that
John is at the party might be a reason for me to go to the party. I
might consider both of these reasons in resolving the question of
whether to go to the party, but I may resolve the question of whether to
go to the party for one of these reasons and not for the other. What
makes the difference is whether I treat the fact that Jane is at the
party or whether I treat the fact that John is at the party as a reason
for going to the party.</p>
<p>The interrogative theory is, again, well placed to explain the kind
of observations we made in the previous section, since it predicts that
when I come to know whether I am going to the party because Jane is
there, I consider reasons for and against going to the party, reasons
like the fact that Jane is there, and the fact that John is there, and I
do not consider reasons for believing that I am going to the party
because Jane is there. Moreover, according to the interrogative theory,
such reasons are irrelevant. In order to resolve the question of whether
to treat some fact (or consideration) as a reason for performing some
action, I do not need good reasons for believing that I will perform
that action for that reason.</p>
<p>Let me emphasise at this point that resolving the deliberative
question of whether to treat some consideration as a reason is not
equivalent to the theoretical question of whether some consideration is
a reason, and nor is it equivalent to the normative (theoretical)
question of whether I should treat that consideration as a reason.<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> If it was, then resolving the
question of whether to treat some consideration as a reason would
involve considering reasons for and against believing that it is a
reason, and would end either in a belief that it is, or a belief that it
isn’t, or it would involve considering reasons for and against believing
that I should treat that consideration as a reason, and would end either
in a belief that I should, or a belief that I shouldn’t. In contrast, if
resolving the question of whether to treat some consideration as a
reason involves considering further reasons at all, it involves
considering reasons for and against treating the consideration as a
reason.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"

<h2 data-number="5.2" id="explaining-symmetry"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Explaining the Symmetry</h2>
<p>We are now in a position to offer an alternative explanation of
Nisbett and Wilson’s symmetry. The key to the explanation is the
following observation. The actor subject resolves the question of
whether some consideration is the reason for which they made the choice
or evaluation they did by resolving the question of whether to
<em>treat</em> that reason as a reason for making the choice or making
the evaluation in question. In contrast, the observer resolves the
question of whether some consideration is the reason for which the actor
subject make her choice or evaluation by resolving the question of
whether the subject resolved the question of whether to treat the
consideration as a reason for making the choice or making the evaluation
in question in the affirmative or in the negative.<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
The observer assumes that the subject is rational to a certain degree
and so assumes that the subject’s choices and evaluations are explained
by the reasons the subject has resolved to treat as reasons. The actor
subject need not make any such assumption about herself. Instead, she
simply resolves the question of whether to treat some consideration as a
reason for making some choice or making some evaluation, and resolves
the question of whether that reason <em>is</em> her reason, by resolving
the question of whether to treat it as her reason.</p>
<p>But then why should two distinct processes lead to the same
explanations, as symmetry predicts? Well, this is because the observer’s
reasoning is guided by the assumption that the subject is rational. The
observer assumes that if something is a good reason for some response,
then, at least typically, the subject will treat it as a reason for her
response, and that if something is a bad reason for some response, then,
at least typically, the subject will not treat it as a reason for her
response. Now, the subject’s reasoning is not, itself, guided by the
assumption of rationality. Rather, the subject’s reasoning simply
<em>conforms</em> to the assumptions of rationality. If something is a
good reason for some response, then, typically, the subject will treat
it as a good reason for the response. If it is a bad reason for some
response, then, typically, the subject will not treat it as a reason for
that response. The upshot is that, although the subject and the observer
use different means, they arrive at roughly the same explanations, just
as symmetry predicts. Moreover, we get the more precise prediction that
both the subject and the observer will tend to assume that the subject’s
responses are explained by things which are good reasons for those
responses, even when this is not the correct explanation of the
responses, and both subjects and observers will tend to deny that some
consideration is an explanation of the response when that consideration
isn’t an obviously good reason for that response.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the explanation works in more detail by considering an
example. Consider Nisbett and Wilson’s reassurance and willingness study
again. Recall that whether a subject received a reassurance made no
difference to how far they went in administering shocks to themselves.
However, actor subjects reported that they went as far as they did
because they received the reassurance. And observer subjects arrived at
similar explanations. According to the interrogative theory, the actor
subject is resolving the question of whether she went as far as she did
because she received the reassurance by resolving the question of
whether to treat the fact that she received the reassurance as a reason
for administering more shocks. Since the fact that she received such a
reassurance is a reason for going further than she otherwise might have,
it isn’t surprising that the actor subject arrives at the explanation
that she did indeed go as far as she did because she received the
reassurance. The observer subject reasonably assumes that the subject
would have treated the fact that she received the reassurance as a
reason for going as far as she did, and infers that it is the reason for
which the subject did go as far as she did. Although the actor subject
arrives at her explanation by a non-inferential means—by resolving a
deliberative question—and the observer subject arrives at her
explanation by inference, they both arrive at the same explanation, in a
predicable way. And, if Nisbett and Wilson are right that this isn’t the
reason why the subject went as far as she did, then both the actor
subject and the observer subject are in error.</p>
<p>The opposite kind of error can be illustrated by considering the job
candidate study. Recall that in that study, actor subjects and observer
subjects denied that the actor subjects judged that the job candidate
was likeable because she was attractive. Yet, Nisbett and Wilson argue
that the actor subject’s judgements were influenced by the fact that the
candidate was attractive. This seems like a clear case where a rational
explanation obtains, and yet both actor subjects and observer subject
deny that it does. We can explain how the actor subject arrives at her
explanation on the hypothesis that she resolves the question of whether
she judged that the candidate was likeable by resolving the question of
whether to treat the fact that the candidate is attractive as a reason
for judging that she is likeable. Since this fact is not a good reason
for judging that the candidate is likeable, it isn’t surprising that the
actor subject denies that it is her reason for judging that the
candidate is likeable. Similarly, the observer subject will assume that
the subject will not treat this fact as a reason for judging that the
candidate is likeable. Again, although the actor subject and the
observer subject are arriving at their explanations by different means,
the nature of those means ensures that they will arrive at roughly the
same explanations.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to see that the interrogative theory
provides an alternative explanation of how we know particular
explanations of our actions and attitudes, one which explains why we can
have such knowledge in the absence of sufficient reasons, explains why
we attend to reasons for and against the actions and attitudes in
question rather than reasons for and against believing that we are
performing those actions or have those attitudes, and, finally, explains
the observed self and other symmetries.</p>
<p>The question remains as to whether the interrogative theory is the
<em>best</em> explanation of these facts about our knowledge of such
explanations of our own actions and attitudes. More needs to be done in
explicating the interrogative theory and defending it against
objections. But I think that we are at least in a position to see that
it is a plausible explanation of the facts about our knowledge of
explanations of our actions and attitudes.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>The claim that we each have a non-inferential way of knowing rational
explanations of our own actions and attitudes, has a diminished status
in contemporary theorising about introspection, compared to the claim
that we each have a non-inferential way of knowing our own actions and
attitudes themselves.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Many theorists happily concede our
knowledge of rational explanations to the inferential theory, while
holding that doing so is not at odds with the claim that we each have a
non-inferential way of knowing our own actions and attitudes. The
following passage from Brie Gertler is representative of this
position:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the staunchest proponents of privileged access acknowledge that
we lack privileged access to these causal relations. So we should be
wary of attempts to challenge the general idea of privileged access by
citing cases in which subjects are ignorant of the causal sources of
their attitudes or actions to challenge the general idea of privileged
access. <span class="citation" data-cites="gertler2011self">(Gertler
2011, 75)</span><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If what I have said in this essay is correct, then this attitude is
misguided. We have much to learn by taking sceptical challenges to
non-inferential knowledge of particular explanations of our own actions
and attitudes seriously.</p>
<p>Whether or not the interrogative theory of self-knowledge I have
sketched here turns out to be correct, we certainly have good reasons to
look for alternative theories of self-knowledge which explain how we can
know particular explanations of our own actions and attitudes in a
non-inferential way, while at the same time explaining why our
explanations pattern with the explanations of suitable placed
observers.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"

<li id="fn5"><p>I have attributed to Nisbett and Wilson a kind of
inference to the best explanation. However, it might be thought that
Nisbett and Wilson’s argument is an argument by elimination. Perhaps
Nisbett and Wilson are arguing that the only possible alternatives here
are inference and introspection on the inner-observation model. It might
be thought that their argument against the inner-observation model of
introspection is that our explanations of our own actions and attitudes
are too unreliable to be explained on the model of introspection, so,
therefore, the inferential hypothesis must be correct. This is closer to
Nisbett and Wilson’s actual argument, but, as we have seen, it is
clearly <em>not</em> their argument. It is true that Nisbett and Wilson
seem to think of the inner-observation model and the inference model as
the only alternatives. But they do so within the context of an argument
to the best explanation, not an argument by elimination. It is plausible
to assume that the inner-observation model of introspection entails some
kind of epistemic advantage which Nisbett and Wilson’s experiments might
bear on. And Nisbett and Wilson often write in ways which suggest that
they think that they show that our explanations of our own actions and
attitudes are too unreliable to be explained on the basis of the
inner-observation model. This is plausible. But it doesn’t follow that
Nisbett and Wilson have an argument by elimination in mind. Rather, they
are just pointing to a reason against thinking that the
inner-observation model is correct. The overall structure of their
argument remains an inference to the best explanation.<a href="#fnref5"

questions of self-awareness. The self-awareness question is one about an
individual: How accurate is he or she at assessing the influences on his

by showing that a group member identifies or fails to identify the
factors that influence the group’ <span class="citation"

<span class="citation" data-cites="Smith:1978aa">(Smith and Miller

data-cites="nisbett_and_bellows">(Nisbett and Bellows 1977)</span>. They

actually was above the mean and vice versa’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="Smith:1978aa">(Smith and Miller 1978, 358)</span>. They
claim that similar reanalyses of the data from other experiments have
the same results: ‘A similar criticism of the data analysis applies to
several other studies: those concerning the effect of distraction on
ratings of movies, the emotional impact of literary passages, and the
effects of reassurance on willingness to take electric shock’ <span

<li id="fn13"><p>Thus we can agree with Victoria McGeer when she writes:
‘…what this research seems to be showing is precisely what tradition
counter predicts, namely, that there are similar patterns of error
across first- and third-person attributions. In other words, not only do
we go wrong about ourselves; but when we go wrong, we tend to do so in
exactly the same ways as we go wrong about others’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="mcgeer1996is">(McGeer 1996, 491)</span>.<a
href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Of course, this argument only works if we assume that
in many case we <em>do</em> know particular explanatory facts about our
actions and attitudes and that the means by which we know them is also
operative in the cases of error that Nisbett and Wilson isolate. This
seems like a reasonable assumption to make. (C.f. Nisbett and Ross:
“This view of the origins of people’s causal accounts does not apply
merely to cases in which such accounts are inaccurate. It applies also
to cases in which such accounts are accurate” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Nisbett:1980aa">(Nisbett and Ross 1980, 211)</span>).
Moreover, the argument assumes that in order to know something by
inference you need sufficient reasons for believing it. Some theorists
hold that you can know something by inference, even if you do not have
sufficient reasons for so believing. So one could respond to the
argument by defending this claim. I don’t think either of these
responses is particularly plausible, but do not have the space to argue
for this conclusion here.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>I should note that Byrne appeals to this observation in
motivating an inferential account of self-knowledge. However, Byrne’s
inferential account appeals to a non-standard conception of inference
and for our purposes can be thought of as a non-inferential account of
self-knowledge.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Perhaps they are arriving at explanations by a kind of
simulation rather than an inference. (See: <span class="citation"
data-cites="Heal:1995aa Gordon:1995aa Goldman:1995aa">(Heal 1995, 47;

the simulation theory see: <span class="citation"

Perhaps. But it is not clear how that would help. Most simulation
theorists accept that some kind of inference is involved. The question
is whether simulation forms part of the process and replaces the role
played by knowledge of a theory hypothesised on the theory-theory <span

<li id="fn21"><p>One might wonder whether Nisbett and Wilson would
accept this presumption. Surprisingly, there is some evidence that they
would. Consider the following passage from Nisbett and Ross: “People
are, despite Nisbett’s and Wilson’s demonstrations, often right in their
accounts of the reasons for their behavior. A person who answers a
telephone and asserts that he did so”because it was ringing” is surely
right. A person who solves a problem by applying an appropriate
algorithm and then asserts that he solved the problem by applying the
algorithm, is right. A person who asserts that he opened the
refrigerator door because he was hungry is usually right. But we have
theories about why we answer telephones, how we solve problems, and why
we open refrigerators, and these theories are usually correct. Because
these theories are so manifestly correct, however, it would require some
ingenuity to find cases in which the knowledgeable observer was not also
correct” <span class="citation" data-cites="Nisbett:1980aa">(Nisbett and

<li id="fn23"><p>This psychological picture is particularly well suited
to views of reasons according to which there are reasons for and against
treating other reasons as reasons. There might seem to be a problematic
regress here. But there isn’t. At some point, one just treats some
consideration as a reason without resolving the question of whether some
further consideration is a reason for treating it as a reason.<a

that observers are arriving at their explanations by a kind of

so, this would explain the symmetries.<a href="#fnref24"
