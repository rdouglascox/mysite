While it is widely held that normative reflection is an effective means
of controlling our emotions, it has proven to be notoriously difficult
to provide a plausible model of such control. How could reflection on
the normative status of our emotions be a means of controlling them?
Higher-order models of reflective control give a special role to
higher-order beliefs and judgements about the normative status of our
emotions in controlling our emotions, but in doing so claim that
higher-order beliefs and judgements have more control over our emotional
lives than they in fact have, and fail to explain some of the central
features of reflective control. First-order models of reflective control
give a special role to first-order evaluative beliefs and perceptions
about the objects of our emotions in controlling our emotions, but in
doing so fail to explain how normative reflection could be a distinctive
means of controlling our emotions at all. In this essay, I defend a
model of reflective control which avoids the twin pitfalls of the
higher-order and first-order models of reflective control, while
learning from them both. I defend a model according to which normative
reflection is a means of bringing our emotions under the control of
reflective reason, where an emotion’s being under the control of
reflective reason is to be understood in terms of its being under the
control of one’s first-order evaluative beliefs and perceptions in
accordance with one’s reflective commitments.

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Is normative reflection a means of controlling our emotions? If so,
what exactly does it give us control over? Does it give us control over
whether we have the emotion in the first place? Does it give us control
over whether we continue to have an emotion we already have? Does it
give us control over the strength of the emotion? Does it give us
control over whether our emotions are under the control of reason? Does
it merely give us control over how we behave in light of our
emotions?</p>
<p>It is widely assumed, both on the basis of ordinary experience, and
on the basis of empirical research, that normative reflection
<em>is</em> a means of controlling our emotions, and that, most
importantly, it gives us control over whether we continue to have an
emotion we already have. A common piece of advice in ordinary life and
self-help books <span class="citation" data-cites="Laurent2013">(e.g.
Laurent and Menzies 2013)</span> is to “step back” and “reflect” on
one’s anger, one’s jealousy, one’s envy, or one’s fear, for instance,
and to ask whether one has any reason to be angry, jealous, envious, or
afraid. So, the claim that normative reflection is a means of
controlling our emotions is part of common wisdom and, we might assume,
has some empirical backing from ordinary experience. The psychological
literature on emotion regulation <span class="citation"
data-cites="Gross1998a Gross1998 Gross1999">(Gross 1998a, 1998b,
1999)</span> has investigated such “cognitive strategies” for
controlling emotions and provides further empirical support for the
hypothesis that normative reflection is a means of controlling our
emotions <span class="citation"
data-cites="Augustine_and_Hemenover2009 Koole2009 Webb2012">(Augustine
and Hemenover 2009; Koole 2009; Webb, Miles, and Sheeran
2012)</span>.</p>
<p>While it is widely held that normative reflection is an effective
means of controlling our emotions, it has proven to be notoriously
difficult to provide a plausible model of such control <span
class="citation" data-cites="Hieronymi2009">(Hieronymi 2009,
156)</span>. Prior to testing the hypothesis empirically we face the
following question: how <em>could</em> normative reflection be a means
of controlling our emotions? How is it meant to work? What would
normative reflection have to <em>be</em>, what powers would it have to
have, in order for it to be a means of controlling our emotions? What
<em>kind</em> of control could normative reflection give us over our
emotions? What limits are there on the control that normative reflection
gives us over our emotions? These are questions we might hope to get
some traction on from the <em>a posteriori</em> armchair <span
class="citation" data-cites="Nolan2015">(Nolan 2015)</span>, drawing on
a priori reflection, common wisdom, and the evidence of the empirical
sciences.</p>
<p>This essay addresses some of these more philosophical questions about
<em>reflective control</em> in this spirit. It will do so while keeping
a close eye on the empirical research that has been undertaken to date
on emotion regulation. I thus hope to provide both the philosophical
foundations for a theory of reflective control and a theory which can
ultimately be subjected to empirical investigation in order to answer
the opening questions of this essay. My main aim is to examine and
reject two models of reflective control, the higher-order model and the
first-order model, and to defend a model which avoids the twin pitfalls
of each of these models. Let me briefly describe each model and my
alternative before getting started.</p>
<p>The higher-order model of reflective control—which has its source in
certain philosophical views about the relationship between normative
thought, rationality, responsibility, and freedom <span class="citation"
data-cites="Burge1996 Korsgaard1996 McDowell1998">(e.g. Burge 1996;
Korsgaard 1996; McDowell 1998)</span> —gives a special role to beliefs
and judgements about the normative status of our emotions in controlling
our emotions, but in doing so, I will argue, gives higher-order beliefs
and judgements more power than they in fact have, and fails to explain
some of the central features of reflective control.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
first-order model of reflective control—which can also be found in the
philosophical literature <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hieronymi2009">(Hieronymi 2009)</span>, but has its source
in the psychologists’ notion of “re-appraisal” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lazarus1991 Gross1998a Gross1998">(Lazarus 1991; Gross
1998a, 1998b)</span>—gives a special role to first-order evaluative
beliefs and perceptions about the objects of our emotions in controlling
our emotions, but in doing so, I will argue, fails to explain how
normative reflection could be a means of controlling our emotions at
all.</p>
<p>I defend a model of reflective control which avoids the twin pitfalls
of the higher-order and first-order models of reflective control, while
learning from them both. I argue that normative reflection is a means of
bringing our emotions under the control of reflective reason, where an
emotion’s being under the control of reflective reason is to be
understood in terms of its being under the control of one’s first-order
evaluative beliefs and perceptions in accordance with one’s reflective
commitments. Unlike the higher-order model, my alternative view gives
first-order evaluative beliefs and perceptions a central role to play,
thus capturing a central insight of work in psychology on reappraisal.
But unlike the first-order model it finds a place for higher-order,
normative <em>reflection</em> in the model which vindicates the thought
that normative reflection is a means of controlling our emotions.</p>
<p>Here’s how I will proceed. I begin, in Section 1, with some very
brief remarks about emotions and associated evaluative beliefs and
perceptions. Then, in Section 2, I make some initial remarks about
normative reflection and control. With these preliminaries out of the
way, in Section 3, I discuss the higher-order model of reflective
control. In Section 4, I discuss the first-order model of reflective
control. In Section 5, I explicate and defend my alternative model of
reflective control.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="emotions-and-evaluations"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Emotions and Evaluations</h1>
<p>In what follows, I will assume that a kind of broadly cognitive
theory of emotions is correct. A cognitive theory of emotion can be
characterised as a theory which “makes some aspect of thought, usually a
belief, central to the concept of emotion and, at least in some
cognitive theories, essential to distinguishing the different emotions
from one another” <span class="citation" data-cites="Lyons1980">(Lyons
1980, 33)</span>. This is a very permissive characterisation of a theory
of emotion. To be a little bit more committal, in what follows, I will
be assuming that emotions are <em>caused</em> and <em>maintained</em> by
broadly evaluative beliefs and perceptions <span class="citation"
data-cites="Arnold1960 Armstrong1968 Lyons1980 Gordon1987 Lazarus1991">(Arnold
1960; Armstrong 1968; Lyons 1980; Gordon 1987; Lazarus 1991)</span>.</p>
<p>In speaking of evaluative beliefs and perceptions, I am speaking of
what psychologists call “appraisals” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Arnold1960 Frijda1986 Lazarus1991">(Arnold 1960; Frijda
1986, 468–69; Lazarus 1991)</span>. These are beliefs and perceptions
which involve abstract, or high-level, evaluations of one’s situation,
such as the perception of someone’s remark as an <em>insult</em> or some
such, or of the goat’s brains as <em>disgusting</em>, or of the bear as
<em>dangerous</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It is perceptions like these which
cause and maintain our emotional responses, but these, in turn, are
caused and maintained by more particular and descriptive beliefs,
judgements, and perceptions, like the judgement that someone
<em>meant</em> what they said, or that the goat’s brain is slimy, or
that the bear is large and approaching fast.</p>
<p>It follows almost trivially from such an account that our emotions
are under the control of reason, in at least one sense of the expression
‘being under the control of reason’. If being under the control of
reason just means being under the control of our evaluative beliefs,
judgements, and perceptions in accordance with rationality, then our
emotions are, to a large extent, under the control of reason. As George
Pitcher notes, on a cognitive theory of emotions “it becomes a little
easier to understand how one’s reason can control one’s emotions” for
“we understand fairly well how reason can control evaluations and some
kinds of apprehensions” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Pitcher1965">(Pitcher 1965, 345)</span>. This is not to say,
however, that our emotions are <em>always</em> under the control of
reason, that they are never irrational. It is just to say that they are
<em>typically</em> caused and maintained by evaluative beliefs and
perceptions in accordance with rationality.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>While it follows almost trivially that our emotions are under the
control of reason on this view, it does not follow trivially that they
are under <em>our</em> control. Contrary to what some philosophers have
claimed <span class="citation"
data-cites="Solomon1973 Solomon1976">(Solomon 1973, 31–32; 1976,
186)</span>, it doesn’t immediately follow from the fact that our
emotions are under the control of reason, that they are under
<em>our</em> control, that they are under the control of the
<em>person</em> whose emotions they are. If our evaluative beliefs and
perceptions aren’t under our control, then how can our emotions be under
our control in virtue of being under the control of our evaluative
beliefs and perceptions? Indeed psychologists have reasoned in the
opposite direction claiming that “[our] inability to control the
motivational and perceptual bases of the appraisal process may explain
[our] inability to control the emotions that result from that process”
<span class="citation" data-cites="Roseman_and_Smith2001">(Roseman and
Smith 2001, 9)</span>. The cognitive theory of emotions may increase the
prospects of our having control over our own emotions, but it doesn’t
trivially entail that we do.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="reflection-and-control"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Reflection and Control</h1>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="normative-reflection"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Normative Reflection</h2>
<p>When philosophers discuss reflection as a means of controlling our
emotions they usually have in mind normative reflection, the kind of
reflection initiated by questions like “Do I have any reason to be
ashamed?” or “Is this a reason to be ashamed?” In calling this
<em>normative reflection</em> what is meant is that it involves the
application of <em>normative</em> concepts like the concepts of reasons,
justification, and appropriateness. These questions differ from purely
factual, theoretical, or descriptive questions about our emotions like
“Am I angry?” or “Am I ashamed?”.</p>
<p>Normative reflection may involve more than just reflecting on such
normative questions. It may involve reflection on non-normative
questions or on normative or evaluative questions about things other
than my emotions themselves. So, I may begin by asking whether I have
any reason to be ashamed of my body, say, and this question might lead
me to take up questions about my body, “Am I really too tall” in the
course of trying to answer this question.</p>
<p>Now, we should be careful to distinguish between reflection in this
sense and what psychologists call “appraisal” and some philosophers call
“evaluation”. When psychologists focus on “reflection” as a means to
control, they speak of “reappraisal” and “cognitive change” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Gross1999">(Gross 1999, 560–61)</span>.
Gross and Thompson refer to cognitive change as “changing how we
appraise the situation we are in to alter its emotional significance,
either by changing how we think about the situation or our capacity to
manage the demands it poses” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Gross_and_Thompson2007">(Gross and Thompson 2007,
14)</span>. So, psychologists tend to be concerned with changes in
evaluative beliefs and judgements about the objects of our emotions.
Only recently has the psychological literature attended to the
distinction between reflection on our emotions themselves and reflection
on their objects. In a recent meta-survey, Webb, Miles, and Sheeran,
distinguish between reappraising one’s emotional response and
reappraising the emotional stimulus <span class="citation"
data-cites="Webb2012">(Webb, Miles, and Sheeran 2012, 778)</span>. We
will keep a clear distinction between higher-order normative beliefs and
judgements about our emotions <em>themselves</em> and first-order
beliefs and perceptions about the <em>objects</em> of our emotions and
our external circumstances in what follows.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="control"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Control</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this essay, I intend to use the word ‘control’
with its ordinary meaning. This is because I think that the this is the
meaning that it is used with when we first ask “Is reflection a means to
controlling our emotions?” We want an answer to <em>this</em> question,
with <em>this</em> sense of ‘control’ for the purposes of ordinary
life.</p>
<p>In order to better understand claims about control we should note
that attributions of control come in two main forms. We speak, on the
one hand, of having control over our emotions. But when we have control
over our emotions, what exactly is it that we have control over? So we
speak, on the other hand, of having control of <em>whether</em> he have
a particular emotion, <em>whether</em> we continue to have a particular
emotion, <em>to what degree</em> we have a particular emotion.
Attributions of control using these interrogative forms are often a lot
more informative than attributions using nominal forms. It will be
important throughout to ask exactly what it is that we have control
over, where the answer to this is given in the interrogative form.</p>
<p>The ordinary notion of control is a causal concept with wide
application. We say, for instance, that the temperature of the room is
under the control of the thermostat. The temperature of a room is under
the control of a thermostat just when there is a kind of causal
dependence between various states of the thermostat and the temperature
of the room. What is it for something to be under the control of a
person? Well, it seems, it is just for there to be a kind of causal
dependence between various states of the person and the that thing. To
put it how it is usually put: it is for there to be a kind of causal
dependence between a person’s <em>will</em> and the thing. So the
ordinary meaning of control is connected to a kind of causal dependence
between states of a thing and something else. In the case of a person,
it is a causal dependence between things and a person’s will. Thus, we
speak here of <em>voluntary control</em>. Within the ordinary notion of
control there is an important distinction to be made between
<em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em> control. The distinction can be
made as follows: one has direct control over something insofar as one
does not control is by means of controlling something else. A man’s
control of his weight is not direct. He controls it by means of
controlling how much he eats and exercises. These latter things may be
under his direct control.</p>
<p>If our question is whether we have <em>direct</em> control over our
emotions, then the answer seems to be obvious: we do not. Our emotions
are not under our direct voluntary control. But this shouldn’t
disappoint us. Our question is whether normative reflection is a
<em>means</em> of controlling our emotions. If it is, it would be an
<em>indirect means</em>: the control we would have would be indirect in
any case. Here it is helpful to think about another indirect means we
have of controlling our emotions: controlling our emotional behaviour.
Psychologists have long noted that we can indirectly control our
emotions by controlling our behaviour. As Willam James writes: “In rage,
it is notorious how we ‘work ourselves up’ to a climax by repeated
outbreaks of expression. Refuse to express a passion and it dies” <span
class="citation" data-cites="James1884">(James 1884, 197)</span>. This
gives us a paradigm example of an indirect means of controlling our
emotions. We will want to know how normative reflection departs from
this paradigm if it is also an indirect means of control.</p>
<p>Some philosophers will prefer to argue that it is a mistake to think
that the question is a question about control in the ordinary sense,
that is, about voluntary control. If we are concerned with broader
questions about rationality, freedom, and responsibility, then we need
to look for a sense of control other than voluntary control. Perhaps
voluntary control is just one species of the broader genus “control” and
the genus, rather than just the species, is what has this connection
with rationality, freedom, and responsibility. This view is usually
motived by the thought that unlike things like headaches, things which
merely happen to us, our emotions are not things which merely happen to
us but are, rather, things we are in some sense responsible for. Since
we do not have direct voluntary control over our emotions, it is argued
that there must be some sense in which we have control over them which
marks the distinction between things which merely happen to us and
things which we are in some sense responsible for. I think that these
philosophers are right to think that there is something important here.
But the failure of these philosophers to provide an account of this
special kind of direct control, despite their continued insistence that
there must be something here, suggests that there is no special sense in
which our emotions are under <em>our</em> direct control. What makes the
distinction here is that our emotions but not our headaches are under
the direct control of reason. But it is one thing for them to be under
the control of reason and another for them to be under <em>our</em>
control.</p>
<p>The only kind of control we care about is voluntary control, where
that is understood as a kind of causal dependence on our wills. The only
question which remains then is to say exactly what <em>we</em> could
hope to have voluntary control over with respect to our emotions. I will
argue that there is a sense in which we can have voluntary control over
whether our emotions are under the control of reflective reason. This is
all the control we need to vindicate the usual claims about rationality,
freedom, and responsibility.</p>
<h1 data-number="4"
id="the-higher-order-model-of-reflective-control"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> The Higher-Order Model of
Reflective Control</h1>
<p>According to the higher-order model of reflective control, in
addition to being under the control of our first-order evaluative
beliefs and perceptions, our emotions are under the control of our
higher-order normative beliefs and judgements. On this model, if I am
angry, say, I may arrive at the conclusion that I have no reason to be
angry and my belief or judgement that I have no reason to be angry will,
if the case is typical, cause me to no longer be angry. The defining
feature of this model is that it is my normative belief or judgement
that I have no reason to be angry which causes my anger to dissipate or
lessen. As David Owens puts it “the instrument of reflective control” on
such views “is a normative higher order judgement” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Owens2000">(Owens 2000, 11)</span>. On this
model, normative reflection is merely a means of arriving at a
higher-order normative belief or judgement.</p>
<p>This model is usually supported by appeal to a certain picture of
rationality. On this picture, our mental states typically conform to the
principle of rationality. The principles of rationality require us to
have certain mental states or combinations of mental states under
certain conditions. And it is plausible to think that the principles of
rationality require you not to have a particular emotion if you believe
you have no reason to have it. Thus, insofar as you are disposed to
conform to the principles of rationality, you will be disposed to cease
having some emotion if you believe that you have no reason to have it.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>We should be careful not to misunderstand the higher-order model. The
view is not that one reaches some conclusion about the normative status
about one’s emotion <em>and then</em> does something to control one’s
emotion accordingly. There is a possible picture on which we engage in
normative reflection in order to work out what the normative status of
our emotion is and then act to bring our emotion into line with our
beliefs about their normative status. So, if I conclude that I have no
reason to be angry I might then take steps to bring it about that I am
not angry, thereby ensuring that I do not have an emotion I believe that
I have no reason to have. On this view, rational reflection is a means
to working out the normative status of one’s emotion which, in turn, is
a means to working out how to act in order not to have unjustified
emotions. The higher-order view, by contrast, holds that one’s emotional
responses are under the direct control of one’s higher-order normative
thought (insofar as one is rational). While <em>our</em> control over
our emotions is <em>indirect</em>, the control of higher-order thought
over our emotions is <em>direct</em> on this model.</p>
<p>With the higher-order model clearly in view we now turn to some
challenges for it.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="reflection-and-suspension"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Reflection and Suspension</h2>
<p>The first challenge is that it doesn’t explain why reflection itself
has consequences for one’s emotional life, prior to, or independent of,
one’s reaching a conclusion about the normative status of one’s emotion.
Consider the following widely quoted passage from Christine
Korsgaard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[O]ur capacity to turn our attention onto our own mental activities
is also a capacity to distance ourselves from them, and to call them
into question. I perceive, and I find myself with a powerful impulse to
believe. But I back up and bring that impulse into view and then I have
a certain distance. Now the impulse doesn’t dominate me and now I have a
problem. Shall I believe? Is this perception really a <em>reason</em> to
believe? I desire and find myself with a power impulse to act. But I
back up and bring that impulse into view and then I have a certain
distance. Now the impulse doesn’t dominate me and now I have a problem.
Shall I act? Is this desire really a <em>reason</em> to act? The
reflective mind cannot settle for perception and desire, not just as
such. It needs a <em>reason</em>. Otherwise, at least as long as it
reflects, it cannot commit itself or go forward. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Korsgaard1996">(Korsgaard 1996, 92–93)</span><a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a particularly apt characterisation of reflection. It sees
reflection as having consequences itself for one’s emotional life. It is
as if the emotion itself is “suspended”, “bracketed”, or “called into
question”, while one is engaged in reflection. As it stands, the
higher-order model has no explanation of this. On the higher order
model, we shouldn’t expect any changes in one’s emotional life until one
reaches a conclusion about the normative status about one’s emotion.</p>
<p>The higher-order model might, however, be modified in order to
account for this. The simplest modification would hold that uncertainty
about the normative status of one’s emotion has the consequence of
suspending, bracketing, or calling into question, the emotion itself.
But it is hard to see how this modification isn’t just ad hoc. Unless
one’s emotion was caused and maintained by a higher-order normative
belief or judgement, it is hard to see how becoming uncertain about the
normative status of one’s emotion could have the consequences of
suspending it. Of course, the higher-order model might claim that our
emotions are caused and maintained by normative beliefs and judgements,
but such a view is not particularly plausible.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="dispassionate-reflection"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Dispassionate Reflection</h2>
<p>The second challenge comes from the possibility of dispassionate,
detached, or disengaged normative reflection. At this stage I want to
take this distinction to be an intuitive one. Here’s how to understand
it. The thought is that I might engage in higher-order normative
reflection on <em>my</em> emotions in just the same way that I might
engage in higher-order normative reflection on <em>your</em> emotions.
When I engage in normative reflection on your emotions, I am just trying
to work out, in the first instance, whether you have any reason for your
emotional response. I may have the further aim of advising you or
criticising you, or perhaps even taking some means to changing your
emotion. Perhaps I want to ensure that <em>you</em> don’t have any
emotional responses you have no reason for having. Now, I can undertake
this kind of reflection on my own emotions. When I do I might be said to
be taking a third-personal, dispassionate, detached, or disengaged
stance towards my own emotions. Of course, this just raises the question
of what it would be to take a first-personal, passionate, attached, and
engaged stance towards my own emotions, and this is a question we will
come to. But for now, I hope that it is intuitively clear enough that
this third-personal stance is <em>not</em> the ordinary stance we take
towards our own emotions in reflection. All I need for the argument of
this section is the claim that there <em>is</em> a distinction here. I
don’t need an account of it.</p>
<p>With this distinction in hand I want to argue that the higher-order
model loses much of its plausibility when we consider normative beliefs
and judgements arrived at by means of this kind of third-personal,
dispassionate, detached, reflection. The proponent of this view is
committed to the claim that it doesn’t matter how these beliefs or
judgements are arrived at, since it is believing that you have no reason
for some emotion and continuing to have the emotion which rationality
does not permit. So no matter how you arrive at the belief, we should
expect your disposition to conform to the principles of rationality to
manifest itself. Now, I want to claim that as a matter of psychological
fact, normative beliefs arrived at in this way have no immediate
consequences for our psychological lives. My normative belief about my
own emotions arrived at in this way has no more consequences for my
emotional life than my normative belief about your emotions has for your
psychological life. Of course, the proponent of the higher-order model
will just deny this since their theory predicts otherwise. But I think
that we intuitively recognise the possibility of such detached
reflection and that a feature of it is that it doesn’t have the
consequences for our psychological lives that engaged reflection does.
And this suggests that the higher-order model is motivated by a
restricted diet of examples.</p>
<p>Let me make this point carefully since it is central to my criticism
of the model. If we begin from ordinary cases of normative reflection,
we can agree with the proponent of the higher-order model that one is
less than fully rational if one concludes that one has no reason to have
a particular emotion but continues to have it. The proponent of the
higher-order model draws two lessons from this. One is that the
principles of rationality require one not to have a particular emotion
if one believes one has no reason to have it and that it is the
normative belief or judgement which causes one’s emotion to dissipate in
accordance with rationality. But this is a hasty conclusion drawn from a
restricted diet of examples. If we consider the possibility of
dispassionate, disengaged normative reflection, we see, in the first
instance, that one’s normative belief or judgement may have no
consequences at all for one’s emotional life. Now, what does this mean
for the higher-order model? Well, the proponent of the model might think
that this does nothing to undermine their story in the ordinary cases.
Cases of dispassionate reflection are cases where one fails to be as one
rationally should be. Somehow cases of dispassionate reflection involve
a masking of this disposition to give up the emotion upon believing that
one has no reason to have it. Now, I don’t want to get embroiled in a
fruitless clash of intuitions about whether in such cases one is less
than fully rational because the principles of rationality prohibit
believing you have no reason to have an emotion while continuing to have
it. What I want us to do is squarely consider the hypothesis of the
higher-order model and the alternative concerning the relevant causal
mechanism, once we have cases of dispassionate reflection clearly in
mind. The alternative hypothesis to the hypothesis offered by the higher
order model takes these cases to show that it isn’t the higher-order
normative belief or judgement which has the consequences for one’s
emotional life. The purported cause is present in this case but the
effect isn’t. With a nod to J.S. Mill we conclude that the normative
belief or judgement is not the cause in the normal cases and we
hypothesise that there is a common cause of the consequences for one’s
emotional life and the higher-order belief or judgement in the normal
cases. But the proponent of the higher-order model, in order to hold
that the belief or judgement is the cause in the normal cases, must hold
that cases of dispassionate reflection are cases of <em>prevention</em>:
there must be something which prevents the normative belief or judgement
from having its ordinary effect in such cases. Since it isn’t at all
clear what this could be, the higher-order model is left without a
plausible explanation.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="higher-order-thought-and-control"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Higher-Order Thought and
Control</h2>
<p>The third challenge for the higher-order model is that, at least as
it has so far been stated, it fails to make sense of the idea that
<em>I</em> have control over my emotions. At best, on this view, my
emotions are under the control of <em>my</em> higher-order normative
beliefs and judgements. Now, why is this a problem? Well, it seems that
unless my higher-order normative beliefs and judgements were under
<em>my</em> control, my emotions wouldn’t be either.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Of
course, I have control over whether or not I engage in normative
reflection. But I don’t have control over the <em>outcome</em> of such
reflection.</p>
<p>Now, it might be argued at this point that this is to misunderstand
the higher-order view. The argument is not of the familiar kind: since
your emotions are under the control of your normative thoughts and your
normative thoughts are under your control, your emotions are under your
control. Rather, someone might argue, <em>one way for your emotions to
be under your control is for them to be under the control of your
normative beliefs and judgements</em>.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> But
it isn’t clear what is gained by speaking this way. Sure, you can use
words this way. But our question wasn’t whether there is a way of using
the word ‘control’ on which our emotions are under our own control. The
question was whether reflection was a means of controlling our emotions.
And even if we grant that this is a way for our emotions to be under our
control, it is hard to see how normative reflection could be a means to
such control. We would just have this control over our emotions.
Normative reflection wouldn’t be a means to it at all.</p>
<p>I suggested above, however, that there is an alternative option open.
The proponent of the higher-order view could distinguish between two
senses in which one’s emotions might be under the control of reason.
They can distinguish between a minimal sense, understood in terms of
one’s emotions being under the control of one’s first-order evaluative
thoughts and perceptions, and a stronger sense of being under the
control of one’s higher-order normative beliefs and judgements. Then
they could argue that normative reflection is a means to bringing one’s
emotions under the control of reason in this stronger sense, since it is
a way of arriving at such higher-order normative beliefs and judgements.
As I will argue below, I think that this is the correct general model,
but, give the other problems with the higher-order model, I think that
it gets the details wrong—it doesn’t properly characterise what it is
for an emotion to be under the control of reflective reason.</p>
<h1 data-number="5"
id="the-first-order-model-of-reflective-control"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> The First-Order Model of
Reflective Control</h1>
<p>Many of the challenges raised for the higher-order model point
towards a first-order model of reflective control. As I pointed out
earlier, normative reflection often involves raising and answering
first-order questions about the objects of our emotions. I reflect on
whether I have any reason to be angry with Jones and then find myself
reflecting on what Jones did, and asking whether he wronged me. My
initial perception of his behaviour may have been that it was meant as
an insult. But I am now questioning my initial perception. In engaged
normative reflection these questions are not bracketed as they are in
dispassionate reflection. I am led by the normative question to open and
consider these questions. In asking whether I have any reason to be
angry with someone, I might consider whether they really meant to insult
me. These questions, and their answers, are, of course, relevant to the
question of whether I have any reason to be angry. Reflective control,
on this model, involves what psychologists call “reappraisal” and as
such is a well established mechanism for emotion regulation. Moreover,
the consequences of changes in first-order thoughts for our emotional
lives has often been noted by philosophers. Solomon calls it “a feature
of emotions that has been pointed out by many analysts” and give an
example: “A change in what I am angry”about” demands a change in my
anger; if I no longer feel wronged by John, who only bought a car that
looks like mine, I cannot be angry at John (for stealing my car) any
longer” <span class="citation" data-cites="Solomon1973">(Solomon 1973,
23)</span>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Nobody doubts that changes in one’s beliefs, judgements, and
perceptions on these matters have consequences for one’s emotional life.
After all, these are the beliefs, judgements, and perceptions which are
agreed to cause and maintain one’s emotion. So it isn’t any surprise
when the belief, judgement, or perception maintaining an emotion is
removed that the emotion itself is removed. So the first-order view just
exploits the explanatory resources already provided by cognitive
theories of emotions. In this sense the first-order theory is very
economical. It also provides plausible explanations of the facts about
suspension and dispassionate reflection.</p>
<p>Consider first the facts about suspension. If one raises the question
of whether someone’s behaviour constituted an insult, one may suspend
one’s belief or judgement that they insulted one, and this has the
immediate consequence of one’s emotion being suspended. As we saw in the
criticism of the higher-order view, we expect the explanation of
suspension to involve a model like this. The first-order view connects
suspension of the emotion to suspension of the first-order evaluative
belief or perception during reflection.</p>
<p>Now consider the facts about detached, disengaged, and dispassionate
reflection. The first-order theory can claim that engaged reflection
involves taking up and considering first-order evaluative questions,
questions about the objects of one’s emotions. This, according to the
first-order theory is just what such reflection is. Detached reflection
brackets these questions. And now it is clear why detached reflection
does not have consequences for one’s mental life while engaged
reflection does.</p>
<p>So if reflection results in a change in one’s emotional life, it is
due to a change in these object-directed evaluative questions, and not
in the answer one reaches to the normative question. And it isn’t very
surprising that if one’s answer to the object-directed question was
arrived at by means of “simple nonconcious, lower level cognitive
processing” then it might change when one engages in “complex,
conscious, high-level cognitive processing” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Roseman_and_Smith2001">(Roseman and Smith 2001, 9)</span>.
Now, of course, the answer one reaches to the normative question will
accord with one’s answer to the object-directed question. Answering
negatively the question of whether he meant to insult you may lead you
to believe that you have no reason to be angry. But the change in
emotion is due to your change in the answer to the former question and
not to the belief that you have no reason to be angry. If this is right,
then it is no surprise that it <em>appears</em> as though reaching
conclusions to questions about the normative status of your emotions
causes a change in your emotional life. But the appearance is deceptive.
There is a common cause of the change in your emotional life and your
conclusion about the normative status of your emotions, namely, your
judgement about the object of your emotion. As Pamela Hieronymi puts
it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]f the alternative picture is correct, the powerful picture
according to which one’s lower-order attitudes conform or are sensitive
to one’s higher-order judgements (insofar as one is rational) is
misleading…. First-order attitudes could not properly be thought of as
<em>sensitive to</em> the higher-order judgement, because, insofar as
one remains of one mind, the first-order attitude will be revised or
suspended in the process of arriving at the higher-order judgement. When
things go well, the attitude and the judgement do not cohabit the mind.
At best, the attitude is sensitive to a stretch of the reasoning that
supports or generates the higher-order judgement. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Hieronymi2009">(Hieronymi 2009, 160–61)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is much to be said for the first-order model then. It is
economical in that it exploits the explanatory resources made available
by cognitive theories of emotion. It avoids the problems of the
higher-order theory in this regard. It also provide an explanation of
the facts about suspension and disengaged reflection. However, it faces
some challenges of its own.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.1" id="first-order-thought-and-control"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> First-Order Thought and
Control</h2>
<p>The first challenge is analogous to the third challenge to the
higher-order view. Suppose we grant that our emotions are under the
control of our first-order beliefs, judgements, and perceptions. How
does that amount to <em>our</em> having control over our emotions? I do
not have control over my first-order beliefs, judgements, and
perceptions. So how can <em>I</em> have control over my emotions? At
best, again, it seems that my emotions are under the control of
<em>my</em> first-order beliefs, judgements, and perceptions.</p>
<p>Now, at this point there are various responses available to the
proponent of the first-order view. The first of which is also available
to the higher-order view, but I have delayed discussing it until here.
The response is to deny that we do not have control over our judgements
or evaluations. Notice my careful change to ‘judgements or evaluations’.
The claim would not be nearly as plausible if it were about ‘beliefs and
perceptions’ since beliefs and perceptions are things we do no have
voluntary control over. Now, as we have already seen, some proponents of
cognitive theories believe that if such a theory is correct, and our
emotions are caused and maintained by our evaluative judgements, then
they are under <em>our </em>control, since our evaluative judgements are
under <em>our</em> control. But this view gets most of its plausibility
from appealing to notions like ‘judgement’, ‘evaluation’, ‘answer’,
‘interpretation’ and ‘appraisal’ which have corresponding verbs
‘judging’, ‘evaluating’, ‘answering’, and ‘appraising’. Now, each of the
latter are clearly things we do and have control over. We judge,
evaluate, interpret, answer, and appraise. But the claim is not that our
emotions are under the control of these <em>activities</em> which we do
have control over. The claim is that they are under the control of
judgements, evaluations, answers, interpretations, and appraisals,
considered as <em>states</em>, and we simply do not have voluntary
control over whether we are in these states.</p>
<p>The proponent of the first-order view might at this point argue that
what we have control over is whether our emotions are under the control
of reason. Since our emotions are under the control of our first-order
evaluative beliefs and perceptions, and reflection is a means of
arriving at or modifying such beliefs and perceptions, it might be
thought that engaging in reflection is means of bringing our emotions
under the control of reason. The problem with this response is that, on
this minimal understanding of ‘being under the control of reason’ our
emotions either are or are not under the control of reason, and engaging
in normative reflection does nothing to <em>bring</em> our emotions
under the control of reason. At best, it exploits the fact that our
emotions are under the control of reason. So this style of explanation
is not available to the proponent of the first-order model.</p>
<p>Now, one might try to argue that there is a sense in which our
judgements, beliefs, and perceptions <em>are</em> under our control, it
just isn’t the kind of control we have been imagining so far. And we can
all agree that if there is a sense in which they are under our control,
they are under control in this sense in a way that our sensations are
not. I have no control over whether I feel a pain in my foot. But I am
meant to have some kind of control over whether I think that you wronged
me. Now, it is true that there is a distinction here. But it isn’t clear
that it is a distinction in kinds of control <em>I have</em> over
things. What we might say here is that yes, my beliefs, judgements, and
perceptions, are, if I am lucky, under the control of <em>reason</em>.
And this certainly is a difference. But are they thereby under
<em>my</em> control? Well, they are under the control of <em>my capacity
for reason</em> and nobody else’s. Someone might want to say that
<em>one way for our beliefs, judgements, and perceptions to be under our
control is for them to be under the control of reason</em>. Well, yes.
But, again this seems to be just another verbal trick. And again, how is
it that reflection is meant to be a means of control if our emotions
simply <em>are</em> under our control in virtue of being under the
control of reason?</p>
<p>So although the first-order view can make sense of the idea of our
emotions being under the control of our first-order evaluative beliefs
and perceptions, it cannot make sense of our emotions being under
<em>our</em> control or of normative reflection being a means of
controlling our emotions. In the next section I argue that this
shouldn’t be surprising given the downgraded status the first-order
model gives to normative reflection.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="higher-order-thought-downgraded"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Higher-Order Thought
Downgraded</h2>
<p>What, according to the first-order theory, is the relation between
normative reflection and first-order reflection? Let’s agree that
normative reflection often involves first-order reflection on the
objects of our emotions. But what is the relation between the two? Why
should someone take up a first-order evaluative question about the
object of their emotion upon engaging in normative reflection? One
answer to this is that the normative question “Do I have any reason to
be angry?” is a question about reasons and the first-order evaluative
question “Did Jones wrong me?” is a question about something which is a
candidate to <em>be</em> a reason. But then we ask: well, why not take
one’s answer to the first-order question for granted, and conclude that,
yes, indeed, you have a reason to be angry with Jones? Why must you
<em>take up</em> the first-order question? If normative reflection could
take place in a way that bracketed the first-order questions, then the
first-order theory’s explanation would not work. Now, the passage quoted
from Hieronymi earlier makes it sound more or less accidental as to
whether someone engaged in normative reflection will <em>take up</em>
the first-order question rather than taking their answer to it for
granted. And a proponent of the first-order theory might claim that this
is all there is to say. Normative reflection has consequences for one’s
emotional life only when it leads one to <em>take up</em> the
first-order question and perhaps only when doing so leads one to suspend
one’s answer to it or change one’s mind. But this seem to significantly
downgrade normative reflection. Moreover, might normative reflection
sometimes have consequences for one’s emotional life without one
changing one’s first-order evaluations?</p>
<p>These problems point to a deeper one. On the first-order theory the
capacity for normative reflection, for normative thought, brings with it
<em>no new powers</em>. A creature with the capacity for normative
reflection has no new powers of control over their emotions that a
creature lacking the capacity does not already have. A creature with the
capacity for normative reflection may more often be led to take up
first-order questions which have consequences for their emotional life.
But that is the extent of it. This seems wrong. And this is something
the higher-order theory seems to have right, for on the higher-order
theory, the capacity for normative reflection brings with it new powers
of control. We need a way of taking what is right from both the
higher-order and first-order model. We need to make sense of the
consequences of first-order thought for our emotions while giving
normative reflection powers of their own. In the next section I will
offer a model which does just this.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="reflection-and-commitment"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Reflection and Commitment</h1>
<p>Let’s take stock. We have seen that the higher-order model of
reflective control mistakenly assumes that the higher-order beliefs and
judgements about the normative status of our emotions play a causal role
in our emotional lives which they do not in fact play. Yet, the
higher-order model does provide us a plausible model of how we might be
said to be able to control our emotions by means of bringing them under
the control of reason. <em>If</em> the higher-order model had a
plausible account of what it is for us to bring our emotions under the
control of reason, then we would have every reason to accept it. But the
higher-order model is based on a mistaken assumption about the power of
normative thought. The first-order model, by contrast, rests on a
plausible assumption about the causal role played by first-order
evaluative beliefs and perceptions about the objects of our emotions.
But it fails to explain the connection between normative reflection and
first-order evaluative beliefs. Sure, in the course of reflecting on the
normative status of our emotions, we <em>might</em> take up first-order
evaluative questions about the objects of our emotions. And if we do,
then we have a nice explanation of the consequences of normative
reflection on our emotional lives. But, then again, we <em>might
not</em> take up these questions. The first-order theory offers no
explanation of the connection between the two. We have also seen along
the way that there is not much to be said for attempts to define a sense
of control distinct from the ordinary sense of control and to claim that
we have this kind of control over our emotional lives. We are interested
in whether reflection is a means to controlling our emotions on a
perfectly ordinary sense of control. The question is what exactly we
have control over in a perfectly ordinary sense of control.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1"
id="two-senses-of-being-under-the-control-of-reason"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Two Senses of Being Under the
Control of Reason</h2>
<p>In order to provide an alternative model to both the higher-order and
first-order theory, I propose that we begin by distinguishing, as the
higher-order theory does, between two senses in which our emotions may
be under the control of reason.</p>
<p>The first sense, as we have seen, is the minimal sense in which our
emotions are under the control of our first-order evaluative thoughts
and perceptions about the objects of our emotions in accordance with the
principles of rationality. As I argued earlier, once we accept a
cognitive theory of emotions it becomes an almost trivial matter to
claim that our emotions our under the control of reason in this sense.
Of course, there will be exceptions, and the extent of the control of
our evaluative thoughts and perceptions over our emotions may be
limited. But, when it is in place, it amounts to the control of reason
over our emotional lives. What we need is a distinct sense in which our
emotional lives might be under the control of reason.</p>
<p>We saw that the higher-order theory fails to provide this. Our
emotional lives being under the control of reason, in this stronger
sense, is not a matter of them being under the control of higher-order
normative thoughts. This view is, on the one hand, psychologically
implausible, and on the other hand, rationally implausible, positing as
it does, a conflict between first-order control of reason and
higher-order control of reason. But I nonetheless think that the
higher-order model points us in the right direction. Where the
higher-order theory goes wrong is in its appeal to beliefs and
judgements about the normative status of our emotions. We need some
other way of marking the distinction.</p>
<p>What we need to appeal to here is the notion of being
<em>committed</em> to some consideration’s being a reason for some
reaction and a corresponding notion of <em>withholding commitment</em>
to some consideration’s being a reason for some response, where being so
committed is distinct from merely believing that something is a reason.
In order to make good on this claim, we are going to need to have a
better understanding of such <em>reflective commitments</em>, of what I
mean by being <em>committed</em> to some consideration’s being a reason
for some response and what I mean by <em>withholding commitment</em> to
some consideration’s being a reason for some response. Now, before
proceeding, I want to be upfront about the challenge I now face. I want
to explicate the notion of reflective commitment. But I want to do so in
a way that isn’t utterly obscure. Many philosophers have felt the need
to appeal to something like commitment or endorsement in this context.<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> But these notions are very hard to
make sense of. The words sound appropriate, but without further
explication the view being gestured at remains obscure. This is
difficult terrain. I want to see if I can do better.</p>
<p>To begin, I want to return to the metaphors of stepping back, gaining
some distance, calling into question, suspending, and bracketing. What
do we step back from, or gain distance from? What is called into
question? What is suspended or bracketed? Korsgaard’s passage suggests
that it is both the mental state in question <em>and</em> one’s reasons
for it. But the question cannot merely be the theoretical question ‘Is
this consideration a reason for me to do so and so?’ which would have
equal application in the third-person ‘Is this a reason for him to do so
and so?’ The question is, in part, whether some consideration <em>is to
be my</em> reason for doing so and so. Merely asking whether something
<em>is</em> a reason for doing so and so, doesn’t call it into question,
suspend it, or bracket it. But asking whether something <em>is to be my
reason</em> for doing so and so immediately calls its status as
<em>my</em> reason for doing so into question, brackets its role,
suspends it <em>qua</em> reason. Now, the question of whether something
<em>is to be my reason</em> for doing something calls for
<em>decision</em> and the resulting state is one of <em>reflective
commitment</em>: one will either end up being <em>committed to</em> the
consideration’s being one’s reason for doing something or will end up
<em>withholding commitment</em> from the consideration’s being one’s
reason for doing something. This is neither a matter of believing that
something <em>is</em> a reason, or <em>it to be</em> one’s reason<em>,
</em>or a matter of* intending or desiring it to be one’s reason*.</p>
<p>So far so good, but the threat of obscurity is looming large. It is
one thing to give a negative characterisation distinguishing reflective
commitments from beliefs, desires, and intentions. It is another thing
to give a positive characterisation. So let me do something more to
explicate the notion of reflective commitment. I will do so in terms of
its typical causes and effects, thereby analysing it in the general
spirit of functionalist theories of mind. Doing so will reveal why
commitment is distinct from both believing and intending. The typical
effect of the state of being committed to some consideration’s being a
reason for having some emotion is for the typical effects of one’s
beliefs and perceptions concerning that consideration in causing and
maintaining one’s emotion to be <em>reinforced</em>. The typical effect
of the state of withholding commitment from some consideration’s being a
reason for having some emotion is for the typical effects of one’s
belief and perceptions concerning that consideration in causing and
maintaining one’s emotion to be <em>inhibited.</em> Reflective
commitment, then, is to be understood in terms of its typical effects of
<em>reinforcing</em> and <em>inhibiting</em> the typical causal roles of
first-order evaluative beliefs and perceptions. These are distinctive
functional roles of reflective commitments and it is these which
distinguish them from beliefs, desires, and intentions. We may also look
to a typical cause of reflective commitment, and that is,
unsurprisingly, <em>normative reflection</em>. Normative reflection on
whether various considerations are reasons for or against will typically
lead to commitment one way or the other.</p>
<p>Reflective commitment also has a role to play in explaining our
ability to answer ‘why’-questions about our emotions in a way that is
independent of observation and inference from evidence. Someone who is
committed to some consideration’s being a reason for being angry will be
disposed to answer the question ‘Why are you angry?’ by offering that
consideration, and someone who is withholding commitment from some
consideration’s being a reason for being angry will be disposed to deny
that that consideration is their reason for being angry. In this way, we
distinguish reflective commitment from belief and intention, since
neither of these are understood in terms of their consequences in
reinforcing or inhibiting the causal roles of other mental states nor in
terms of their grounding our capacity to speak for our reasons without
relying on observation or inference.</p>
<p>By understanding reflective commitment in terms of its typical
effects of <em>reinforcing</em> and <em>inhibiting</em> the typical
causal roles of first-order beliefs and perceptions we have avoided
utter obscurity and staked out a claim which may or may not be true. If
there are no mental states the typical effect of which is to reinforce
or inhibit the causal roles of first-order beliefs and perceptions, then
there are no states of reflective commitment. We can argue for such
states on the basis that they best explain the facts about reflective
control. That will be my strategy for the remainder of this essay.</p>
<p>With the notion of reflective commitment now firmly in hand, we can
make sense of two kinds of normative reflection one might engage in.
Disengaged, dispassionate, or theoretical reflection is normative
reflection which merely aims at belief or knowledge. One engages in such
reflection merely with the aim of working out what the normative status
of one’s emotion is. In contrast, there is a kind of engaged,
passionate, or deliberative reflection, which is normative reflection
which aims at commitment. Normative reflection is <em>engaged</em>
insofar as the question is not merely one of whether some consideration
<em>is</em> a reason but, rather, is whether the consideration <em>is to
be one’s</em> reason.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>We are now in a position to define a stronger sense of an emotion’s
being under the control of reason. It is under the control of reason in
this stronger sense when the role played by one’s evaluative beliefs or
perceptions about its object is grounded in one’s being committed to the
content of that belief or perception as a reason for having the emotion
in question. We can also see how the absence of such an emotion can be
under the control of reason in this stronger sense, if its absence is
due to the typical effects of a particular belief or perception being
inhibited by one’s withholding commitment. And with this stronger sense
of an emotion’s being under the control of reason in hand, we can
explain how normative reflection can be a means of bringing our emotions
under the control of reason in this stronger sense. We engage in such
reflection with the aim of arriving at a commitment concerning reasons
for and against having that emotional response. Call this stronger sense
of being under the control of reason being under the control of
<em>reflective reason</em>. What is under our control, then, in the
perfectly ordinary sense of control, is whether our emotions are under
the control of reflective reason.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="reflective-control-explained"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Reflective Control
Explained</h2>
<p>We can now explain why merely by engaging in such reflection our
emotion may be suspended. Once the normative question has been raised
with a view to determining whether to commit to the reason as a reason,
the default is to <em>withhold commitment</em>. Now, withholding
commitment, unlike simply not being committed or being uncommitted, is a
<em>positive state</em>. One counts as <em>withholding commitment</em>
only if one has considered the question of whether something is to be
one’s reason. Thus, insofar as one remains uncommitted, upon engaging in
reflection, one <em>withholds commitment</em>. And if such withholding
is effective, then one’s first-order evaluative beliefs and perceptions
do not play their typical role in causing and maintaining one’s
emotional response. Thus, we can explain how the emotion may be
suspended merely upon engaging in reflection. We can also explain why
reflection may have consequences for one’s emotional life even though
one hasn’t changed one’s views at all about the first-order facts. There
may be mere differences in commitment. So we do better than the
first-order view here. But we incorporate the first-order view’s
important focus on first-order evaluative questions about the object of
our emotions, for what we commit ourselves to, and what we withhold our
commitment from, are considerations about the objects of our emotions.
The power of normative reflection is limited to <em>reinforcing</em> the
rational dispositions which are already in place or <em>inhibiting</em>
the rational dispositions which are already there. It cannot create
<em>ex nihilo</em> such a disposition, so it cannot bring about an
emotional response <em>ex nihilo</em> (in the way that a mere normative
belief or judgement could on the higher-order view). So we avoid the
kind of conflicts in control by unreflective and reflective reason the
higher-order view is committed to.</p>
<p>In appealing to the notion of commitment and withholding commitment,
I am not claiming that these are things we have direct control over.
Just like higher-order beliefs and judgements, and first-order beliefs
and perceptions, we do not have control over our commitments. We engage
in normative reflection, aimed at arriving at commitment, considering
reasons for and against getting angry, and we either arrive at a
commitment or end up withhold commitment. Normative reflection aimed at
commitment is, in this sense, just like normative reflection aimed at
belief, and first-order evaluative reflection. If someone wants to say
that <em>we</em> have control over our own emotional lives <em>merely in
virtue of</em> our emotional lives being under the control of reason, in
the stronger sense just characterised, then they are welcome to. But I
don’t see what could be gained by insisting on this way of talking. I
do, however, think that when our emotional lives <em>are</em> under the
control of reason in this sense, then our emotional lives have a deeper
claim to being <em>truly our own</em>. There <em>is</em> a sense in
which by engaging in normative reflection aimed at arriving at a
commitment, we more fully face up to, and take responsibility for, our
emotional lives. This is a sense that goes beyond the sense in play when
our emotional lives are under the control of reason in the weaker,
minimal sense. They have a deeper claim to being truly our own because
there’s nowhere to step back to, outside the point of view of our
commitments, to distance ourselves from our emotional responses, in the
way that normative reflection provides a way of stepping back from our
first-order beliefs and evaluations and the role they play in causing
and maintaining our emotions. So I think it would be better to say that
by engaging in normative reflection I more fully make my emotions
<em>mine</em>, than it would by to say that by engaging in normative
reflection I have control, in some special sense, over my emotions.
There’s just no special sense in which <em>I</em> have control over
whether I have the emotions in question. The control I have over my
emotions is just the ordinary kind of voluntary control. But it isn’t,
at least in the first instance, voluntary control over whether I have
some emotion or continue to have it. I can’t pick and choose. Rather,
what I have voluntary control over, in the first instance, is whether my
emotion is under the control of reflective reason. And normative
reflection aimed at commitment is a means of bringing my emotion under
the control of reflective reason.</p>
<h1 data-number="7" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>I have argued that the <em>kind</em> of control <em>we</em> have over
our emotions is the same kind of control we have over the position of
our limbs, or the position of the phone on our desk. But I have argued
that <em>what</em> we have control over is not, in the first instance,
<em>whether</em> we have a particular emotions or <em>to what
degree</em> we have them. Rather, <em>what</em> we have control over is
<em>whether our emotions are under the control of reflective
reason.</em> I have characterised being under the control of reflective
reason in terms of being under the control of our first-order evaluative
beliefs and perceptions in accordance with our reflective commitments.
And I have given an account of reflective commitments which supports
this view. On this view, normative reflection is a means of arriving at
reflective commitments and is thus a means of bringing our emotions
under the control of reflective reason. Now, I want to end by pointing
out that in having this kind of control we will often have control over
whether we continue to have particular emotions. This is a consequence
of this view, since many of our emotions cannot survive the scrutiny of
normative reflection aimed at commitment. We find ourselves unable to
arrive at a positive commitment to many of the things we
pre-reflectively take to be reasons for particular responses. Upon
reflection, many of these considerations appear ridiculous to us. It
isn’t as the first-order view would hold, that we change our initial
evaluative beliefs or perceptions about the world. We rather find that
we can’t commit to treating the various considerations as reasons. And
so our emotions dissipate. Knowing all of this we can see that normative
reflection <em>is</em> a means of controlling our emotions in the
additional sense that we can often extinguish problematic emotions
merely by engaging in normative reflection. The advice of common life
and self-help books isn’t so bad after all: only reflect! (But let that
not be their only sermon).</p>
