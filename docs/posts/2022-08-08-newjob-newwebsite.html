        <p>Now that I have a new job at the University of Sydney (Associate Lecturer in Political Philosophy), I thought it was about time for me to update my website. I decided to put my newly acquired Haskell skills (thanks COVID!) to use and decided to use <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> to generate a static website from mainly markdown files. This is probably overkill. But I think it looks good. Plus it will be easier to maintain than my old website now that Iâ€™ve got it up and running.</p>
