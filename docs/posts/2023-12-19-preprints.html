        <p>Pre-prints of several of my papers are now available on the <a href="../research.html">research
page</a> of this site. Where possible, I have made both an .html
and a .pdf version of the paper available. Many of my papers are available
through open access. Where this is the case, I link directly to the journalâ€™s
version. Over time, I will make the remaining papers available as preprints.</p>
