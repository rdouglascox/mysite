<p> I'm a philosopher based at the University of Sydney in
the Discipline of Philosophy in the School of Humanities. </p>

<p> I am interested in a wide range of philosophical topics,
but specialise in political philosophy, the philosophy of
mind and action, and philosophy of language.  </p>

<p> I have written on issues relating to our knowledge of
our own minds, on issues relating to the syntax and
semantics of why-interrogatives, and, more recently, on the
relationship between democracy and social equality.  </p>

<p>  I am currently working on philosophical issues relating
to educational justice, political legitimacy, first-person
thought, agency, reason for action, and  the role of
perspectival thought in the humanities.  </p>

<p> I live in Sydney with <a
	href="https://www.luaraferracioli.com">my
	partner</a> and our three children.  </p>

<p> You can find me on PhilPapers <a

and on PhilPeople <a
