This essay explores the nature of the relation between democracy and
social equality. It critically evaluates the egalitarian view that
democracy is necessary for full social equality and that democracy is an
important constituent of social equality. On such a view, inequalities
in power and de facto authority are taken, in certain circumstances, and
in the absence of certain dispositions to refrain from exercising such
power and authority, constitute a form of social inequality. On the
basis of a series of cases, I argue that such a view is mistaken, and
that political inequalities are, at best, causally and contingently
related to social inequality. I argue that a better explanation of what
is wrong with inequalities in power and de facto authority in many cases
is that they can be used to extract greater consideration for those with
greater power.

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Recent egalitarian theorizing has drawn attention to the importance
of a conception of social equality understood in terms of all members of
a society relating to each other as equals.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> On
such a conception of social equality, there appears to be a particularly
intimate connection between democracy and social equality.
Democracy—understood in terms of all members of a society having an
equal opportunity to influence political decisionmaking—appears to be
<em>necessary</em> for social equality—understood in terms of all
members of a society relating to each others as equals. Democracy
appears to be an important <em>constituent</em> of social equality.</p>
<p>While egalitarian theorists have often assumed that there is an
intimate relation between democracy and social equality, only recently
have they attempted to clarify the exact nature of the relation between
social equality and democracy and to argue that such a relation obtains.
Earlier egalitarian theorists seem to have held that while social
equality was intimately related to democracy, democracy only bore a
<em>contingent</em> and <em>causal</em> relation to social
equality—democracy, perhaps, was seen to be more likely than other forms
of government to lead to social equality. Many recent egalitarian
theorists, however, have wanted to argue that the relation between
democracy and social equality is more intimate than this. They have
wanted to argue that democracy is <em>necessary</em> for social equality
and that it is an important <em>constituent</em> of social equality.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> For instance, Niko Kolodny has
argued that democracy is “necessary for full or ideal social equality”
<span class="citation" data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny
2014b, 308)</span> and that it “is a particularly important constituent
of a society in which people are related to one another as social
equals” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneI">(Kolodny 2014a, 196)</span>;
Elizabeth Anderson has argued that hierarchies of command are
constitutive of social inequality and has investigated the ways in which
democratic forms of government turn relations of rulers and subjects
into relations of agents to principals, where “democratically
accountable officeholders” do not “constitute a social hierarchy in the
sense of distinct classes of rulers and ruled” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Anderson2012-Equality">(Anderson 2012, 43–44, 48)</span>;
Samuel Scheffler has argued that “[t]he ideal of a society of equals” is
“subject to the presumption that each participant in an egalitarian
relationship is equally entitled to participate in decisions made within
the context of the relationship” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Scheffler2015-PracticeEquality">(Scheffler 2015, 38)</span>;
and, more recently, Daniel Viehoff has written that he is “sympathetic
to the theory that equality is a constitutive component of certain
non-derivatively valuable relationships” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Viehoff2019-PowerEquality">(Viehoff 2019, 8)</span>.</p>
<p>The question of the nature of the relation between democracy and
social equality bears directly on the issue of the nature of
justifications of democracy in terms of social equality. Many democratic
theorists seek non-instrumental justifications of democracy
<em>over</em> alternative forms of government.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> If
democracy—understood as requiring political equality—is necessary for
full social equality, then insofar as we have an interest in relating as
equals to those whom we stand in ongoing social relations with, we will
have a non-instrumental <em>pro tanto</em> reason to support democracy
over alternative forms of government. Thus we have the beginnings of the
kind of justification of democracy which goes beyond the standard
instrumental justifications of democracy, and may favour democracy over
the alternatives, even if democracy does not turn out to be the
instrumentally best form of government.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>My aim, in this essay, will be to argue that the relation between
democracy and social equality is, at best, a <em>contingent</em> and
<em>causal</em> relation. It follows that there can be no
non-instrumental justification of democracy in terms of social
inequality, so understood.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> While I agree with
egalitarian theorists that we have an interest in relating as equals to
those whom we stand in ongoing social relations with—that is, I agree
with the egalitarian assumption behind this kind of argument for
democracy—and I agree that there is an intimate relation between
democracy and social equality, I believe that it is a mistake to think,
as recent egalitarian theorists do, that democracy is <em>necessary</em>
for social equality and that democracy is an important
<em>constituent</em> of social equality. My case against the
constitution thesis—the thesis that democracy is necessary for social
equality and is an important constituent of social equality—will involve
presenting a series of cases which show how democracy and social
equality can come apart. This, of course, is an appropriate methodology
for assessing claims of necessity and constitution. However, I will not
rest my case entirely on such judgements about these cases. By
presenting an alternative account of the relation between democracy and
social equality, one on which democracy is merely contingently and
causally related to social equality, I will attempt to explain away the
initial appearance of a necessary and constitutive connection between
democracy and social equality. I will argue that a better explanation of
what is problematic about inequalities in power and de facto authority
in the political context is that they can be <em>used</em> to establish
or reinforce social inequalities either through the direct exercise of
that power, or can be used by those with perceived greater power and de
facto authority to extract greater consideration from those with less
power and authority.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The discussion is structured as follows. I begin, in section two, by
locating the topic of social equality and examining the argument for
thinking that democracy is an important constituent of social equality
and is necessary for full social equality. In section three, I argue on
the basis of a series of examples against the claim that democracy is
necessary for full social equality. I argue that these examples show
that the relation between democracy and social equality is, at best,
causal and contingent and use the examples to motivate the alternative
extraction theory. In section four, I compare my argument for this
conclusion with a related argument by Richard Arneson. In section five,
I briefly discuss the implications of my conclusion for non-instrumental
justifications of democracy.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="democracy-and-social-equality"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Democracy and Social
Equality</h1>
<p>I will begin, in this section, by locating the topic of social
equality. It is important for my purposes that we have an independent,
pre-theoretical grasp of the notion of social equality and of its
normative significance. I will then make some general remarks about the
structure of claims about social equality and the normative foundations
of social equality before turning to recent analyses of the notion of
social equality. With these theoretical and pre-theoretical
understandings in hand, I will then examine the case for thinking that
democracy is necessary for social equality, and for thinking that
democracy is an important constituent of social equality.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="social-equality-locating-the-topic"><span
class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Social Equality: Locating the
Topic</h2>
<p>The notion of social equality that is of interest to us is one that
is best introduced in terms of the notion of members of a society
relating to each other as equals. Egalitarian theorists often speak of
social equality in such terms. For instance, Elizabeth Anderson writes
that egalitarians are committed “to creat[ing] a community in which
people stand in relations of equality to others” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Anderson1999-WhatisPoint">(Anderson 1999, 289)</span>. One
way of understanding talk of “relations of equality” is in terms of
<em>how members of a society relate to each other</em>. Do the members
of a society relate to each other as equals or do they relate to each
other as inferiors to superiors or superiors to inferiors? Standing in
relations of equality to each other, on this understanding, is a matter
of relating to each other as equals as opposed to superiors or
inferiors. This understanding is in play when Samuel Scheffler writes
that egalitarians should care about “the establishment of a society of
equals, whose members relate to one another on a footing of equality”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="Scheffler2015-PracticeEquality">(Scheffler 2015, 21)</span>.
And it is this understanding which is in play when David Miller
writes:<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Equality] identifies a social ideal, the ideal of a society in which
people regard and treat one another as equals—in other words, a society
that does not place people in hierarchically ranked categories such as
classes. We can call this … kind of equality <em>equality of status</em>
or simply <em>social equality</em>. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Miller1999-PrinciplesSocialJustice">(Miller 1999,
232)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that we each have a good pre-theoretical understanding of
the notion of relating to each other as equals involved in social
equality. We are able to identify paradigmatic cases where some members
of a society relate to each other as superiors to inferiors. We
immediately recognise the relation of lord to peasant, of patricians to
plebians, of Brahmins to untouchables, of Blacks to Whites (in the
reconstruction era South, at least), as relations of superior to
inferior. Not only do we immediately recognise these relations as
relations of superior to inferior, but we immediately recognise the
normative significance of these relations: they are relations we have
good reason to avoid. It is by reflecting on such paradigmatic examples,
and variations on such examples, and using our pre-theoretical
understanding of the notion of relating to each other as equals, that we
can start to build a theory of social equality. What is it about these
paradigmatic examples of social inequality which make them examples of
social inequality?</p>
<p>We will examine an attempt to answer this question in a moment. But
before doing so I want to make a few remarks about the structure of
claims about social equality which should be common ground among
theories of social equality. At the heart of the notion of relating as
equals is the notion of relating to each other in a society. The notion
of ‘relating’ to each other is a capacious one, and it includes all of
the ways that members of a society may relate to each other in a
society, from how they interact personally to how they structure their
physical environment. I take it to be a task of a theory of social
equality to say which of these ways of relating are ways of relating as
equals, and which are ways of relating as superior to inferior. It is
plausible that some ways of relating to each other will only count as
ways of relating as superior to inferior in certain contexts or in
certain circumstances. So, for instance, relating to another as one with
greater power or authority, may not be a way of relating as superior to
inferior in certain contexts, but may be in another context. As we are
about to see, recent egalitarian theorists hold that relating to another
as one with greater power or authority <em>does</em> amount to relating
as superior to inferior, at least in the political context.</p>
<p>As I just said, we immediately recognise the normative significance
of relations of social inequality. We recognise that they are relations
we have good reason to avoid. I agree with egalitarian theorists that
the reasons we have to avoid such relations are non-instrumental
reasons. We have reasons to avoid such relations for their own sake. It
may well be that the claim that we have good reason to avoid social
inequality is moral bedrock. It may be the kind of claim that does not
admit of further defense. I suspect, however that the claim that we
<em>ought</em> to <em>relate</em> to each other as equals is somehow
grounded in the idea that we <em>are</em>, in some important sense,
equals. We ought to relate to each other as the equals we in fact are.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> In the absence of now discredited
views that some human beings <em>are</em> naturally superior or
naturally inferior, most now believe that all human beings <em>are</em>
morally equal, and, as such, ought to relate to each other as the equals
we are. As a consequence, our social relations—how we relate to each
other in society—ought to reflect this basic fact about us and we ought
to relate to each other as the equals we are. It is a familiar point,
however, that relating to one another “as equals” may involve a great
deal of unequal treatment. Our question is whether political equalities
are the kind of equalities which are required for the kind of treatment
as equals, relating to each other as equals, required for social
equality. I mention this foundation of the normative significance of
social equality only to point out that it is plausible, whether we take
it to be moral bedrock or not, that we have good reason to avoid social
inequality for its own sake.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Having located the topic of social equality, let us now turn to
recent attempts to answer the question of which ways of relating to each
other in particular contexts or particular circumstances are ways of
relating as equals and which are ways of relating as superior to
inferior.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="analyses-of-social-equality"><span
class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Analyses of Social
Equality</h2>
<p>Recent egalitarian theorists have attempted to analyse social
equality and inequality, to isolate those features of the paradigmatic
cases which make them cases of social equality or social inequality.
Perhaps the most sustained attempt to offer such an analysis in the
recent literature comes from Niko Kolodny. Whereas theorists like
Anderson have drawn attention to important differences between different
kinds of social hierarchies and their characteristic
varieties—hierarchies of domination and command, hierarchies of esteem,
and hierarchies of standing—Kolodny has been the most explicit about
attempting to isolate the features of these different kinds of
hierarchies which <em>make them</em> problematic cases of social
inequality.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> It is partly for this reason that I
will focus on Kolodny’s analysis here. Another reason for focusing on
Kolodny’s account is that, as we will see below, Kolodny foresees a
particular kind of objection to analyses of social equality in terms of
equalities of power and authority and modifies his account in order to
avoid this kind of objection. Although I will mainly focus on Kolodny’s
analysis, I take the arguments of the next section to tell against any
attempt to analyse social equality in terms of equality in power and de
facto authority.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, we can begin to develop an account or analysis
of social equality by reflecting on paradigmatic cases of social
inequality, drawing on our pre-theoretical understanding of relating as
equals, and attempting to isolate the features which make them cases of
social inequality. This is the approach taken by Kolodny. Since it is
difficult to distinguish judgements about social equality, and relating
as equals, from judgements about distributive equality or distributive
justice, Kolodny considers an example of a “society administered by a
class of ascetic warriors” in which distributive justice is perfectly
administered, and the warriors themselves in no way benefit from the
distribution they administer: each is given their due, including the
warriors themselves, and any benefits which accrue to them in virtue of
having the authority they do is offset by their depriving themselves of
other advantages. Kolodny writes that, even in such a society, where
everyone has been given their due: “there is an obvious sense in which
[the ascetic warriors] constitute a superior social stratum, occupy a
higher position in the hierarchy” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b, 295)</span>.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Reflecting on this example, Kolodny
asks “[W]hat is present in the societies that we have described….that
might account for the intuitive presence of social inequality?” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b,
295)</span>. According to Kolodny “[i]t seems to have to do with the
following” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b,
295–96)</span>:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Some having greater relative <em>power</em> (whether formal or
legal, or otherwise) over others, while not being resolutely disposed to
refrain from exercising that greater power as something to which others
are entitled.</p></li>
<li><p>Some having greater relative <em>de facto authority</em> (whether
formal or legal, or otherwise) over others, in the sense that their
commands or requests are generally, if not exceptionlessly, complied
with (although not necessarily for any moral reasons), while not being
resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising that greater authority as
something to which those others are entitled.</p></li>
<li><p>Some having attributes (for example, race, lineage, wealth,
perceived divine favor) that generally attract greater
<em>consideration</em> than the corresponding attributes of
others.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are plausible candidates for being the features of the example
in virtue of which it is an example of social inequality.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
Since it will be important for the discussion to follow, I want to draw
attention to the “while”-clauses in (i) and (ii): “while not being
resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising that greater
power/authority as something to which others are entitled”. According to
Kolodny, “What social equality requires is that ‘natural’ power be
regulated by the <em>right</em> dispositions” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b, 296
n. 8)</span>. The thought here is that some having greater relative
power over others may not be seen as problematic if those who have the
greater power are resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising that
power as something to which others are entitled, for in such a case the
inequality in power will be regulated by the right dispositions. It is
only when those with greater power are not so disposed that greater
power becomes problematic. As we will see, this qualification is
essential to Kolodny’s view and we will be able to distinguish a
<em>simple</em> view of the relation between inequalities of power and
de facto authority and social inequality—a view which takes such
inequalities themselves to suffice for social inequality—and Kolodny’s
more complex view—a view which holds that such inequalities, in the
absence of the relevant dispositions, and in certain circumstances,
suffice for social inequality.</p>
<p>These are the three characteristic features of social inequality
then: asymmetries in power, asymmetries in de facto authority, and
asymmetries in consideration.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> These asymmetries are
characteristic of cases where members of a society fail to relate to
each other as equals. Now, we might ask whether each asymmetry is
necessary for social inequality, or whether any asymmetry is
independently sufficient for social inequality. Kolodny suggests that
the consideration component of social equality “need not be essential to
the argument that a concern for social equality implies a concern for
democracy” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b, 298)</span>. He
thinks that the power and de facto authority components “may suffice for
the argument” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b, 298)</span>. In
other words, according to Kolodny, asymmetries in power and de facto
authority—in certain contexts—might suffice for social inequality—that
is, they might suffice for a failure to relate as equals. Of course,
asymmetries of consideration are nonetheless central to our
understanding of social inequality, and it seems that asymmetries here,
while perhaps not necessary, may independently <em>suffice</em> for
social inequality. This is a point to which we will return later.</p>

class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The relation between democracy
and social equality</h2>
<p>Now that we have located the topic of social equality and have a
candidate analysis of social inequality in hand, we can ask how
democracy is supposed to relate to social equality so understood. As I
said earlier, whether a way of relating to each other is a way of
relating as equals or as superior to inferior is often a matter of
context. Relating to another as one with greater power need not always
amount to relating as superior to inferior. After all, there are
inequalities in power and de facto authority across many contexts of our
social lives, from churches to universities and workplaces, and we do
not find these inequalities in power and authority problematic, and we
do not think they suffice for a kind of social inequality.<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> In order to argue that democracy is
<em>necessary</em> for social equality, and that democracy is an
important <em>constituent</em> of social equality, we need to know what
it is about the political context which explains why inequalities in
power and de facto authority <em>suffice</em>, in this context, for
relations of social inequality? According to Kolodny, the “three
features of political decisions” which are relevant here are <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneI">(Kolodny 2014a,
226)</span>:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>that subjection to them is non-voluntary</li>
<li>that they are treated as having final authority</li>
<li>that they involve the use of force</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Kolodny, then, insofar as these are features of the
political context, inequalities in power and de facto authority will
<em>suffice</em> for relations of social inequality in the political
context.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> These features do plausibly explain
why inequalities in power and authority are problematic in the political
context but not in other contexts.</p>
<p>With these claims in place, we are now in a position to connect
democracy and political equality to social equality: since subjection to
political decisions is non-voluntary, and political decisions are
treated as having final authority, and political decisions involve the
use of force, if there are asymmetries of political power and authority,
then there is at least some failure to achieve the ideal of social
equality.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> So the thought is that once we bear
in mind these features of the political context, we will see that
asymmetries of political power and authority (in the absence of certain
dispositions) suffice for, or constitute, a form of social inequality.
Under such conditions, those with greater power relate to those with
less as superiors to inferiors. Insofar as we have an interest in
standing in relations of social equality to those we share ongoing
social relations with, we will have at least a <em>pro tanto</em> reason
to support democracy over alternative forms of government, since only
democracy, by definition, involves equalities in (opportunities for)
relative power and de facto authority.</p>

Democracy and Social Equality</h1>
<p>While I find much to agree with in the egalitarian argument, I
believe that the relation between democracy and social equality is not
as tight as many egalitarians think it is. In this section I will begin
by presenting an example which, I will argue, shows that mere
inequalities in power and de facto authority do not suffice, even in the
political context, for social inequality. This example tells directly
against the simple view of the relation between democracy and social
equality mentioned in the previous section. It does not, however, tell
directly against Kolodny’s version of the argument, but it does set the
scene for an examination of Kolodny’s more complex view. On the basis of
an additional series of cases, I will argue against Kolodny’s more
complex view. I will argue that inequalities of power and de facto
authority, together with the absence of certain dispositions, do not
suffice for social inequality.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1"
id="why-mere-inequalities-in-power-and-de-facto-authority-do-not-suffice"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Why mere inequalities in power
and de facto authority do not suffice</h2>
<p>Consider a futuristic society which conforms to Kolodny’s conception
of a social democratic utopia: all members of the society have an equal
opportunity to influence political decisions and all relate to each
other as social equals—no one is “above” or “below” anybody else. Using
the wonders of modern technology, this society is able to ensure that
voting on a range of issues is as easy as going to the local store.
Indeed, it does this by making digital voting machines widely available
throughout the society. In this society the voting machines work
perfectly, and everybody’s vote is registered exactly once.</p>
<p>Now consider an almost identical society, which differs from
Kolodny’s social democratic utopia in only one respect: unbeknownst to
everyone in the society, there is a serious fault with the voting
machines. They register the votes of almost half of the citizens—those
with names beginning with the letters A through M, say—correctly, but
they register the votes of the other half of the citizens—those with
names beginning with other letters, N through Z, say—twice. A
consequence of this, let us suppose, is that the outcome of votes in
this second society never differ from those in the first hypothetical
society. Because there is nothing suspicious about the outcomes of the
decisionmaking process, nobody ever stops to wonder whether there is a
fault with the voting machines and nobody ever comes to know that the
votes of some are counted twice.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that those with names beginning with the letters N
through Z in the second society have greater power and de facto
authority than those with names beginning with the letters A through M.
To use Kolodny’s vocabulary and image, some have greater
<em>contributory influence</em>, where their greater influence can be
modelled in terms of their applying a vector of force which has a
greater magnitude than the vector of force applied by others in
determining the result of the vote <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneI">(Kolodny 2014a, 200)</span>. So,
the two societies certainly differ with respect to the distribution of
power and de facto authority. Now, the crucial question for us is this:
do these societies <em>also</em> differ with respect to how their
members relate to each other? Do some relate to others a superiors to
inferiors? By hypothesis, members of the first society relate to each
other as equals. Do members of the second society relate to each other
as equals, or do some relate to others as superiors to inferiors? It
seems to me that there is <em>no difference</em> between the two
societies with respect to <em>social equality</em>: even though some
have more power and de facto authority than others in the second society
they do not thereby relate to those others as superiors to
inferiors.</p>
<p>This kind of example is a problem for the simple view of the relation
between democracy and social equality but not for Kolodny’s more complex
view. The case involves the features which Kolodny claims make
inequalities in power and de facto authority problematic: subjection is
involuntary; the authority is final; and force is involved. It involves,
after all, political decisions. Yet, even with these conditions in
place, mere inequalities in political power and de facto authority do
not suffice for social inequality. We seem to have an example on our
hands where there are inequalities in political power and de facto
authority and yet there is no social inequality. Political equality is
not necessary for full social equality. The example does not, however,
immediately tell against Kolodny’s more complex view, since, as we saw,
it is important for Kolodny that inequalities in power and de facto
authority be accompanied by the absence of particular dispositions. For
Kolodny, social inequality involves some having greater relative power
“while not being resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising that
greater power as something to which those others are entitled” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b,
295)</span>. There is nothing in our example to suggest that those who
have the greater power are not resolutely disposed to refrain from
exercising that greater power as something to which the others are
entitled. Perhaps they are. (This is a point I will return to
below).</p>
<p>Before moving on to raise problems for Kolodny’s more complex view, I
want to consider whether the conclusion I have drawn from the example
can be resisted and whether the simple view of the relation between
democracy and social equality can be defended. How might my conclusion
be resisted? Suppose someone disagrees with my verdict that there is no
difference in how people relate to each other between the cases in the
relevant sense. How might they do so? Well, it should be immediately
conceded that the members of the second society do not relate to each
other in exactly the same way as members of the first society do in a
very broad sense of “relate to each other”: even though they do not know
it, some members of the second society relate to others as those with
more power and de facto authority. The question for us, however, is
whether <em>this</em> is a way of relating as superior to inferior, or a
way of relating as equals. And here it might be thought that this just
<em>is</em> a way of relating as superior to inferior, since having more
power and de facto authority is characteristic of superiority. But this
borders on question-begging. There may be <em>a</em> sense in which some
relating to others as those with more power and de facto authority is a
way of relating as superior to inferior. But, this itself does not seem
to be incompatible with them relating as equals in the relevant
sense.</p>
<p>It would be disappointing if our disagreement here amounted to
nothing more than a verbal disagreement about the application of the
expression “social equality”. I think that we can make progress,
however, by considering each of the characteristic features of social
inequality identified by Kolodny independently. It should be very clear
that in the examples provided there are no asymmetries of consideration
in the relevant sense. In terms of consideration, members of the second
society certainly relate to each other as equals. Since asymmetries in
consideration are a large component of what we object to when we object
to the idea of relating as superior and inferior, this is what explains
why we do not find the second society particularly problematic. Now let
us ask whether there is anything particularly problematic about the
asymmetries of power and de facto authority in the second society. On
the face of it, there does not seem to be anything particularly
problematic here.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Insofar as relations of social
inequality are meant to be problematic, this would suffice to show that
there are no relations of social inequality here. Alternatively, we
might concede that there does seem to be something problematic here, but
then we might attempt to explain away the appearance. We might argue
that our concern with asymmetries of power and de facto authority stems
from our concern to avoid asymmetries in consideration. It is primarily
because greater power and authority can be used to <em>extract</em>
differences in consideration, that we object to it. But for it to be so
used, those who have it need to know that they have it, and those who do
not need to know that they do not. Since those with more power and
authority do not know that they have it in the second society, we
correspondingly find the asymmetry either not problematic at all, or far
less problematic than in cases where there is a risk of the asymmetries
being used to extract differences in consideration.</p>
<p>What the example seems to support, then, is what I will call, the
<em>extraction</em> theory of the bad of inequalities in power and de
facto authority: inequalities in power and de facto authority are
problematic not because, in certain circumstances, they constitute
social inequalities, but because, in certain circumstances, they can be
<em>used</em> to <em>extract</em> greater consideration for those with
greater power. A view like this is suggested by Michael Walzer when he
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the fact that there are rich and poor that generates
egalitarian politics but the fact that the rich ‘grind the faces of the
poor,’ impose their poverty upon them, command their deferential
behavior. Similarly, it’s not the existence of aristocrats and commoners
or of office holders and ordinary citizens (and certainly not the
existence of different races or sexes) that produces the popular demand
for the abolition of social and political difference; it’s what
aristocrats do to commoners, what office holders do to ordinary
citizens, what people with power do to those without it. <span
class="citation" data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">(Walzer 1983
xii–xiii)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extraction theory can be contrasted with <em>constitutive</em>
theories on which the bad of inequalities in power and de facto
authority, in certain circumstances, <em>constitute</em> or
<em>suffice</em> for social inequalities. The example of the faulty
voting machines seems to directly support the extraction theory over a
simple constitutive theory of the bad of inequalities in power and de
facto authority. Insofar as we find inequalities in power and authority
problematic, it is because they can be <em>used</em> to extract greater
consideration for those with greater power. However, since the example
does not tell against Kolodny’s more complex version of the constitutive
theory, it does not support the extraction theory over Kolodny’s theory.
I will consider Kolodny’s theory in more detail in the next section. But
before doing so, I want to fill out the extraction theory a little more
in order to have something concrete to compare Kolodny’s theory
with.</p>
<p>In order to fill out the extraction theory a little more, it might be
helpful to return to Kolodny’s statement of the third characteristic
feature of cases of social inequality. Kolodny’s original statement of
the consideration condition is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="i">
<li>Some having attributes (for example, race, lineage, wealth,
perceived divine favor) that generally attract greater
<em>consideration</em> than the corresponding attributes of others.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the extraction theory one of the relevant attributes
here might be perceived greater power. Some having perceived greater
power might generally attract greater <em>consideration</em> than the
corresponding attributes of others. The extraction theory effectively
subsumes the inequalities in power condition under the inequalities in
consideration condition.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> Something like this
view is suggested in the following passage from Miller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… social equality is a matter of how people regard one another and
how they conduct their social relations. It does not require that people
be equal in power, prestige, or wealth…. What matters is how such
differences are regarded, and in particular whether they serve to
construct a hierarchy in which A can unequivocally be ranked as B’s
superior. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Miller1999-PrinciplesSocialJustice">(Miller 1999,
239)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Miller, then, social equality is “a matter of how people regard
one another and how they conduct their social relations”, that is, it is
a matter of consideration. Inequalities in power, prestige, or wealth,
according to Miller, are not in themselves problematic from the point of
view of social equality. Rather, the issue is how these differences are
regarded. Do those with perceived greater power, prestige, or wealth,
generally attract greater consideration? Do those with perceived greater
power, prestige, or wealth, <em>use</em> this perception to
<em>extract</em> greater consideration? According to the extraction
theory, differences in consideration will be largely due to those with
greater power using that power to <em>extract</em> greater consideration
from those with less power. It may well be that, in addition to this,
those with greater power simply attract greater consideration without
those with greater power using their power to extract such
consideration. Even in such cases it may be possible to speak of greater
consideration being <em>extracted</em> from those with less power. I
will say something about the difference between merely attracting
greater consideration, and that consideration being extracted from
others in a moment.</p>
<p>In order to fully fill-out the extraction theory, more will need to
be said about what consideration is such that some having attributes
which generally attract greater consideration than the corresponding
attributes of others constitutes a form of social equality. Following
Kolodny, we can get an initial fix on the notion of consideration by
thinking of those responses that social superiors, as social superiors,
characteristically attract <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b, 297)</span>.
Such responses would include responses of showing certain forms of
deferential respect, fawning and toadying, bowing and scraping <span
class="citation" data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">(Walzer 1983
xiii)</span>, other forms of deference, and efforts to ingratiate or
curry favour <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b, 297)</span>. We
tend to recognise responses that social superiors, as social superiors
characteristically attract, when we see them. It is very difficult to
say exactly what characterises this class of responses, however. They
are all inherently ways of relating as inferior to superior. They all
involve treating someone as superior, even if those who respond in these
ways do not believe that the other is somehow above or superior. But
what is it about these responses which <em>makes</em> them inherently
ways of relating as inferior to superior? How do they differ from other
forms of positive responses which are not inherently ways of relating as
inferior to superior? As Kolodny notes, the class of responses which
constitute consideration is partly characterised by the fact that
although the basis of these responses is generally some narrow
accidental feature of the person, the response is generally focussed on
the person themselves and their interests and claims <span
class="citation" data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b,
298)</span>. Moreover, the responses are practical matters that deal
with the person and claims of the person and have an agent-neutral
character—the relevant feature is seen as calling for the same response
from everyone <span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2014-RuleOverNoneII">(Kolodny 2014b, 298)</span>.
However, as Kolodny notes, these conditions are not sufficient to
characterise the relevant notion of consideration, and a full account
remains elusive.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> My own view is that relating as
equals in our social interactions is largely a matter of
<em>experiencing ourselves as being equals</em> in our social
interactions. Some ways of responding to others involve an
<em>experience</em> of subordination, or inferiority. Here I am taking
seriously Walzer’s claim that “the experience of subordination—of
personal subordination, above all—lies behind the vision of equality”
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">Walzer
(1983)</span> xiii). This experience is not a response to a perception
of superiority in another, rather, it belongs to the form of response
itself. It may be especially grating to have to respond to someone with
perceived greater power in a way that is accompanied by an experience of
subordination or inferiority when one firmly believes that the person
with perceived greater power is <em>not</em> superior to oneself. It is
this experience of inferiority, I think, which justifies talk of the
<em>extraction</em> of greater consideration. The consideration is felt
as being extracted from the inferior and granted to the superior.<a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> We might think of class of
responses which constitute consideration as practical responses to the
whole person which are based on perceived accidental features of the
person and which have an agent-neutral character and are accompanied by
an experience of inferiority on the part of those whose responses they
are. What I have offered here is an initial sketch of what a theory of
consideration might look like and how it might be developed. Given my
aims in this paper, I will not attempt to develop the theory in any more
detail here. For my purposes, it is enough to have a clear view of the
alternative approach that I want to contrast Kolodny’s theory with.</p>
<p>To sum up the argument to this point. I have argued that the example
of the faulty voting machines poses a problem for the simple view of the
relation between democracy and social equality. Inequalities in power
and de facto authority appear to be compatible with full social equality
even in the political context. I have just suggested that any lingering
sense that these inequalities are problematic may be explained on the
hypothesis that we think that such inequalities are problematic because,
when those who have greater power know that they do, they can use their
greater authority and power to extract greater consideration from
others, thus undermining social equality. Now, someone like Kolodny
could well agree with the conclusions reached so far. He could agree
that mere inequalities in power and de facto authority do not themselves
suffice for social inequality. And he could agree that such inequalities
are often problematic because they can be used to extract differences in
consideration. However, Kolodny will want to say something stronger
also. He will want to claim that such inequalities, together with the
absence of certain dispositions, <em>suffice</em> for a kind of social
inequality. If so, then there would be a reason, over and above the fact
that such inequalities can be used to extract greater consideration, for
objecting to inequalities in power and authority. And we would have a
less empirical and contingent reason in favour of democracy over the
alternatives.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2"
id="on-the-absence-of-dispositions-to-refrain-from-exercising-power"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> On the absence of dispositions
to refrain from exercising power</h2>
<p>What does Kolodny mean when he says that social inequality involves
some having greater relative power over others “while not being
resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising that greater power as
something to which those others are entitled”? We can start to get a
feel for what he means by reflecting on why, in the example of the
faulty voting machines, even though half of the society <em>does</em>
exercise its greater power and de facto authority, they may nonetheless
possess the disposition Kolodny is referring to. In the example of the
faulty voting machines, half of the society exercises its greater power
and de facto authority <em>unknowingly</em>. They are disposed to
exercise their greater power <em>unknowingly</em>. But this is perfectly
compatible with their being resolutely disposed to refrain from
exercising it <em>knowingly</em>. It may be that if those with greater
power discovered that they had it, they would immediately stop
exercising it and seek to have equality of power restored.</p>
<p>This explains why the example of the faulty voting machines does not
pose an immediate problem for Kolodny’s view. For all that we have said,
members of the society might be resolutely disposed to refrain from
exercising their greater power as something to which others are
entitled. Now, at this stage, we might wonder what would happen if we
simply stipulated that members of the society are <em>not</em> so
disposed. Consider, then, the first society, the society without faulty
voting machines. Suppose each member of that society <em>would</em>
happily exercise greater power over others, if they could get it. But as
things stand, there is no means for them to get more power, and they are
not particularly interested in trying to get more power. While this may
reflect badly on their character, it is doubtful that merely not being
resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising greater power over others
would suffice for a form of social inequality. Suppose that we carry
this condition over to the society with faulty voting machines, again
supposing that members of the society are not aware of the fault. Do we
not now have an example where there are inequalities of power and de
facto authority, together with the absence of a disposition to refrain
from exercising such greater power and authority? Well, yes and no.
There is <em>a</em> sense in which those with greater power lack a
resolute disposition to refrain from exercising it, they are just not in
a position to exercise the power knowingly, since they do not know that
they have it. But it would be uncharitable to understand Kolodny’s
position this way. It would be more charitable to understand Kolodny as
holding that those who have the greater power are such that (i) they are
in a position to exercise it knowingly and (ii) they are not resolutely
disposed to refrain from exercising their greater power as something to
which others are entitled. This gives a deeper reason for thinking that
examples like the faulty voting machines, which turn on the absence of
knowledge of greater power, do not pose an immediate problem for views
like Kolodny’s. For Kolodny, greater power is problematic, in part, when
those who have it are in a position to exercise it knowingly, and yet
are not resolutely disposed to refrain from doing so for the right
reasons.</p>
<p>While Kolodny’s theory is not immediately threatened by the examples
we have considered so far, I think that there are related examples that
<em>do</em> pose an immediate problem for Kolodny’s view. Consider a
variation on the faulty voting machines example where the fault is due
to a devious programmer. The programmer studied political philosophy for
many years, and, being unable to find an academic job, turned to
programming, and became involved in programming software for voting
machines. After a few years of running his social experiment with the
faulty voting machines, he decides to change things up a bit. He
secretly contacts those whose votes are counted twice, letting them in
on this fact. Since he explains his role, those who he contacts have
good reason to take him at his word. Now, the programmer is careful to
ensure that each of those he contacts does not know who else’s votes are
counted twice. And those whose votes are counted twice have good reason
to think that if they tried to discover who else had greater power, they
would come undone, and the whole system would be undermined. Suppose, as
in the variation on the example we were discussing a moment ago, members
of this society are not resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising
their greater power knowingly. Indeed, the programmer may have explained
to them that, since those with greater power have basically been
randomly selected, their exercising their greater power makes no
difference to the outcome of the voting procedure. In light of this,
those with greater power may think that it does not really matter that
they have and exercise greater power. They exercise it more from
indifference than malice.</p>
<p>We now have an example where all of Kolodny’s conditions for social
inequality are met: subjection is involuntary; the authority is final;
force is involved; and some have greater power and de facto authority
while not being resolutely disposed to refrain from exercising that
power and authority as something to which others are entitled. Yet,
intuitively, there is no more social inequality in this society than in
our original society. There is no relevant difference in how members of
this society relate to each other. There is no reason to think that
those who choose to exercise their greater power in the circumstances
hold a malevolent attitude to other members of their society. Those who
know they have greater power and de facto authority are in fact rather
lonely in their knowledge, since they know that as soon as they seek to
share their knowledge, the whole system will unravel. It is their lonely
secret. Moreover, in light of the fact that they also know that their
having this greater power makes no difference to the outcomes, it would
be hard for them to develop a sense of superiority over others. Having
greater power is nothing to them.</p>
<p>If it is agreed that there is no more social inequality in this
society than in our original society—the one in which the voting
machines work as they should—then we have a counterexample to Kolodny’s
position <em>as stated</em>. There are, however, two paths of response
open at this stage: a proponent of the constitutive theory might resist
the verdict about the case, or they may argue that a small adjustment
can be made to the theory in order to avoid this kind of example while
still retaining the spirit of the theory. I will examine each kind of
response in turn.</p>
<p>There are two ways that a proponent might try to resist my verdict
about the case. They might just bluntly state an opposed intuition about
the case. Or they might argue that the case is sufficiently similar to
cases where we judge that there is a kind of problematic social
inequality involved. Suppose someone bluntly states an opposed
intuition. Then we can consider similar arguments to those we considered
in the previous section. We might ask what is meant to be so problematic
about the circumstances in this society? There may be a lingering sense
of social inequality here. But again, we should consider what is meant
to be problematic about this combination of greater power and the
absence of certain dispositions. The example under consideration is
designed both as an example where Kolodny’s conditions are met, but also
as an example where we have ensured that those with greater power and
authority are not in a position to extract greater consideration,
<em>even though</em> they know they have greater power and authority. By
hypothesis, if they were to try to extract greater consideration, the
whole system would come undone. So they cannot use their greater power
to extract greater consideration. Even if we think that merely having
greater power while lacking the relevant disposition is problematic, it
is nowhere near as problematic as when that greater power can be used to
extract greater consideration. So, again, we should consider an error
theory of any intuitions about inequalities in power in the absence of
certain dispositions amounting to social inequality. Indeed, once we are
considering such dispositions, we should be even more tempted by an
explanation in terms of the extraction theory. For, it is plausible to
think that those who would not be resolutely disposed to refrain from
exercising their greater power, in ordinary cases, would also not be
disposed to refrain from extracting greater consideration on the basis
of their having greater power. There is a risk that this line of
reasoning may simply lead to a clash of intuitions about the case,
however. So let us now examine how a proponent of the constitutive
theory might offer an argument to resist the verdict about this
case.</p>
<p>A proponent of the constitutive theory might argue that the case at
hand is sufficiently similar to a kind of case which is clearly
problematic and which clearly involves social inequalities. They may
conclude from this that the case at hand involves social inequalities,
but perhaps to a lesser degree. The kind of case the proponent of the
constitutive theory will appeal to will be a case involving rule by a
secret society, or the Illuminati, for instance.<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
To bring this case as close as possible to the case at hand, we might
imagine that the Illuminati has hired our programmer to introduce the
bias into the voting system, and to have the votes of members of the
Illuminati counted twice. And, of course, every other member of the
society would be left in the dark. Now, we certainly would find such an
example problematic. There is something objectionable about secret rule
by the Illuminati. And the example has similarities to the case at hand.
Those with less power are not aware that those with greater power have
greater power, and if their power were to be discovered, the whole
system would collapse. Given that we find this example so problematic,
why should we not find the original example of the devious programmer
problematic? Well, there is an important disanalogy between the example
of the Illuminati and the original example. Since the members of the
Illuminati are mutually aware of their having greater power, and can
communicate their intentions with nods and winks without being noticed,
they can be said, collectively, to exert a kind of <em>intentional
control</em> over the decisionmaking process that the individuals with
more power, taken collectively, could not be said to exert, in the case
at hand. I suspect that this is what drives our intuitions about the
Illuminati example. And since it is missing in the original example of
the devious programmer, our intuitions about the Illuminati example
should not be taken to bear on the original example.</p>
<p>An interesting question remains, however, as to whether we think that
the Illuminati example is problematic because it involves relations of
social inequality, or whether we think it is problematic for some other
reason. Do members of the Illuminati relate to other members of the
society as <em>social</em> superiors? My sense is that they do not. Here
is why: it does not seem to matter for our verdict about what is
problematic about the Illuminati example whether members of the
Illuminati are members of the society they control, or whether they are
members of another society, ruling the original society remotely. So the
issue does not seem to be one about <em>how</em> members of a society
relate to each other at all. Now, it might be said that, nonetheless,
when those with greater power who are members of a collective which
controls the decisionmaking process, <em>are</em> members of the same
society that they control, they are <em>thereby</em> socially superior.
This is fine, but it amounts to a stipulative use of ‘socially
superior’, and what is problematic about <em>this</em> instance of
social superiority would be shared with cases of foreign rule, and is
not explained in terms of a failure to relate as equals. In any case,
since those with greater power in the original example are not members
of a collective which exerts a kind of <em>intentional control</em> over
the decisionmaking process, this line of reasoning does not provide an
argument against our verdict about this example.</p>
<p>The second way a proponent of the constitutive theory might respond
to the example of the devious programmer is by arguing that a small
adjustment can be made to the theory in order to avoid this kind of
example while still retaining the spirit of the theory.<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
The proponent of the constitutive theory might think that the lesson of
the first example of the faulty voting machines is that to have greater
power or de facto authority over others in the relevant sense—that is,
in the sense that is constitutive of social inequality—it is not merely
enough that one have <em>greater contributory influence</em>. It
requires that one <em>know</em> that one does. In response to the
example at hand, they might argue similarly, that to have greater power
or de facto authority over others it is not enough to <em>know</em> that
one has greater contributory influence, those who have lesser
contributory influence must <em>know</em> that you do. In other words,
perhaps the kind of inequalities in power which are constitutive of
social equality are inequalities of power which are common knowledge. At
the very least, it might be thought that in order for inequalities in
power to be constitutive of social inequality, those with less power
must have an inkling that some have more power than they do. So why not
amend Kolodny’s statement of the conditions which constitute social
inequality as follows:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Some having greater relative <em>power</em> (whether formal or
legal, or otherwise) over others, while not being resolutely disposed to
refrain from exercising that greater power as something to which others
are entitled, where those with lesser relative power have an inkling
that those with greater relative power have greater relative power.</li>
</ol>
<p>Would this amendment not be largely in the spirit of the constitutive
theory and save it from the counterexample? Is it not just obvious that
this is what a proponent of the constitutive theory should say? My view
is that it will not do simply to amend the theory in this way. What the
constitutive theorist needs is that inequalities in power themselves be
at least <em>in part</em> constitutive of social equality. They can
amend the theory by claiming that it is inequalities of power
<em>together with</em> an inkling on the part of those at the losing end
of the equalities which constitute social inequality. But this opens
them to two objections. First, why should adding knowledge or suspicion
on the part of those at the losing end to inequalities in power suddenly
<em>amount</em> to a failure of social equality? What does mere
suspicion of inequalities of power add to inequalities of power such
that together they suddenly <em>constitute</em> social inequalities?
Would not a better explanation be that the suspicion of inequalities of
power are <em>causally</em> relevant to social inequality? Would not
those who suspect that they have less power than others fawn over those
with more power and give them greater consideration? Second, once this
possibility is noticed, there is a threat that inequalities of power
themselves will drop out of the picture as irrelevant. Either it is the
suspicion of greater power that constitutes the social equality, or it
is the suspicion of greater power that is causally relevant to social
equality. Either way, there is no work for <em>actual</em> inequalities
in power to do in constituting social inequality. I will now present an
example which, I think, shows that inequalities in power do, in fact,
drop out of the picture as irrelevant in either case.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3"
id="why-inequalities-of-power-and-de-facto-authority-add-nothing"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Why inequalities of power and
de facto authority add nothing</h2>
<p>Consider a final variation on the faulty voting machine example. This
time, begin with a society where, by design, the system is meant to be a
system of plural voting. In this society it is common knowledge that the
votes of some are counted twice while the votes of others are counted
only once. Moreover, and predictably, those with more power use their
power to extract greater consideration, so there is significant social
inequality supported by the system. Those with more power relate to
those with less as superiors to inferiors. But now here is the twist.
Our devious programmer has been at it again, and while it is widely
believed that the votes of some count for more than the votes of others,
this is not in fact the case, and everyone’s vote is counted only once.
So one means by which those with perceived greater power might have
actually had greater power has been closed off. This is not to say,
however, that in this example everybody has equal power. It may well be
that those with perceived greater power nonetheless <em>do</em> have
slightly greater informal power, since they will be able to influence
the decision-making of others through their perceived greater power.</p>
<p>Let us now ask if things would be <em>worse</em> from the point of
view of social equality, if the programmer had done his job correctly,
and programmed the plural voting scheme. That is, let us ask if things
be worse if there were greater informal inequality of power and
authority in the society. If the programmer had done his job correctly,
then, in addition to the social inequality due to the extraction of
greater consideration, and the purported inequalities due to whatever
greater power the perception of greater power gives to those who are
perceived to have greater power, there would be <em>additional</em>
social inequality constituted by some having, through the formal voting
system, greater power and de facto authority while not being resolutely
disposed to refrain from knowingly exercising such power and authority.
But, on the face of it, things would <em>not</em> be worse from the
point of view of social equality if this were the case. All of the
damage is already done by the widespread <em>belief</em> that some have
more power and authority. No further damage is constitutively done by
there <em>actually</em> being additional asymmetries in power and
authority accompanied by the absence of certain dispositions. On the
plausible assumption that this is not simply a case of
over-determination, we should conclude that inequalities of power and de
facto authority do not suffice in the circumstances for additional
social inequality.</p>
<p>This case confirms the suspicion raised at the end of the previous
section that once we add knowledge or belief to the picture, the
asymmetries in power due to actual differences in contributory influence
drop out of the picture as irrelevant. And this should lead us to see
the earlier example of the devious programmer in a new light. There we
introduced the hypothesis that it was really what those with greater
power could do with power that we objected to, and which led to social
inequality. Now we can see that they need not actually have greater
power. There only needs to be a mutual perception that they have greater
power.</p>
<p>This completes my case against both the simple view of the relation
between democracy and social equality and Kolodny’s more complex view of
this relation. Neither mere inequalities in power and de facto
authority, nor inequalities in the absence of certain dispositions,
suffice, in the political context for social inequality. When those
lacking a disposition to refrain from exercising greater power have
greater power over others but are not in a position to extract greater
consideration, there is no threat to social equality, and merely having
greater power while lacking the relevant disposition does not suffice
for social equality. Moreover, when some are in a position to extract
greater consideration on the ground of their supposedly having greater
power and authority, their actually having greater power and authority,
and their lacking the disposition to exercise it, does nothing
constitutively to further undermine social equality.</p>
<p>At this stage it might be worth briefly returning to consider
Kolodny’s motivating example, the society of ascetic warriors. Why might
we have been initially inclined to agree that in such a society there
was a problematic form of social inequality? Well, I suspect that it is
partly because the example is under-described. Kolodny is eager to
describe the case as one in which the requirements of distributive
justice are met. But we know little else about how members of the
society respond to rule by the ascetic warriors. Perhaps we would not
judge the example to be problematic if it came closer to our examples of
the faulty voting machines, and there was some factor which ensured that
the warriors would not attract greater consideration in virtue of their
perceived greater power. Perhaps we judge the example to be problematic
only because we assume that their having perceived greater power would
attract greater consideration. We cannot conclude immediately on the
basis of considering the example that it is the inequality in power and
de facto authority which constitutes the problematic social inequality.
We need examples like those we have been considering which attempt to
tease apart inequalities in power and de facto authority from
inequalities in consideration. I have argued that when we consider such
examples, we see that it is ultimately the inequalities in
consideration, inequalities which can be extracted by those with
perceived greater power from those with lesser power, which constitute
the problematic forms of social inequality.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="a-comparison"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> A Comparison</h1>
<p>In this section I compare the argument given above with a related
argument offered by Richard Arneson in the context of discussing Philip
Pettit’s work on non-domination.</p>
<p>The argument I have just given is structurally similar to an argument
briefly sketched by Richard Arneson in a discussion of republican
freedom or freedom as non-domination (in the broader context of a
discussion of social equality). As Arneson notes, a central theme in
Pettit’s work on freedom as non-domination is that freedom as
non-domination is instrumentally valuable as a means to avoiding certain
relations of social inequality <span class="citation"
data-cites="Arneson2010-DemocraticEqualityRelating">(Arneson 2010,
46)</span>. For Pettit, the connection between domination and social
inequality is mediated by common knowledge. Here is the crucial passage
from Pettit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Domination is generally going to involve the awareness of control on
the part of the powerful, the awareness of vulnerability on the part of
the powerless, and the mutual awareness—indeed, the common awareness
among all the parties to the relationship—of this consciousness on each
side. The powerless are not going to be able to look the powerful in the
eye, conscious as each will be—and conscious as each will be of the
other’s consciousness—of this asymmetry. Both will share an awareness
that the powerless can do nothing except by the leave of the powerful:
that the powerless are at the mercy of the powerful and not on equal
terms. The master-slave scenario will materialize, and the asymmetry
between the two sides will be a communicative as well as an objective
reality. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Pettit1997-RepublicanismTheoryFreedom">(Pettit 1997,
60–61)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Pettit, then, domination is a means to social inequality.<a
href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> When it is common knowledge that
there are relations of domination, these relations can be used to
extract differences in consideration, in social status. Having drawn
attention to this aspect of Pettit’s view, Arneson then writes: “This
comment on the badness of dominating power raises the question: suppose
the [conditions for domination] obtain but nobody knows this is so, or
nobody knows but the dominant party, and domination is never exercised,
so none of the envisaged bad consequences occur” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Arneson2010-DemocraticEqualityRelating">(Arneson 2010,
46)</span>. The first part of what Arneson is asking us to suppose is
similar to what we supposed in the initial version of the faulty voting
machines example: “suppose nobody knows this is so”. The question
Arneson then asks is whether, on this supposition, relations of
domination would be non-instrumentally bad. He then reports the
intuition that they would not be, and in light of the foregoing
discussion of the faulty voting machines example, we can agree.<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Arneson draws the following moral:
“Pettit’s discussion calls attention to the fact that one might object
to inequality of power without prizing equality of power <em>per
se</em>” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Arneson2010-DemocraticEqualityRelating">(Arneson 2010,
47)</span>.</p>
<p>In the previous section, I argued that Kolodny’s position is not
directly susceptible to this style of argument. For Kolodny, asymmetries
in power and de facto authority are not problematic in and of
themselves. They are problematic only in conjunction with the absence of
certain dispositions. We have seen, however, that this style of example
can be extended to target Kolodny’s position and we ended up with a view
very similar to Pettit’s here. We concluded that asymmetries in power
and de facto authority are problematic primarily because they can be
used to extract additional consideration for those with perceived
greater power. When it is common knowledge that they obtain, asymmetries
of power and de facto authority can be <em>used</em> as means to social
inequality. This is a point well-made by Pettit in his discussion of the
instrumental value of non-domination.</p>
<p>It is striking that Kolodny does not comment on this aspect of
Pettit’s view when he compares his own approach to Pettit’s. In
Kolodny’s discussion of Pettit on freedom as non-domination, Kolodny
suggests—rightly in my view—that our concern with non-domination may not
be so much with being under an arbitrary and alien will itself, but with
being “on the losing end of an asymmetry of power with another person”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="Kolodny2019-BeingPowerOthers">(Kolodny 2019, 106)</span>.
Given the passage I quoted above, it may be plausible to re-interpret
Pettit as being concerned more with asymmetries of power rather than
with being under an arbitrary and alien will.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
However, reinterpreting Pettit’s concerns in this way would see
asymmetries in power and de facto authority as potential <em>means</em>
to social inequality, and not as sufficing for or constituting social
inequality in the political context. After all, Pettit insists that
inequalities in power would be problematic even in the presence of a
robust disposition not to knowingly exercise them. From our point of
view this looks plausible, since those with greater power could still
use that power to extract greater consideration, <em>even if</em> they
were in fact resolutely disposed not to knowingly exercise that
power.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="conclusion"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Where does our discussion leave the egalitarian argument for
democracy? Well, in my view, the foregoing does not have any significant
implication for the conclusion of the argument, namely, that we have
reason to prefer democracy over other forms of government. Nor does it
give us any reason to think that there could be no good argument from
considerations about social equality for democracy. It rather has
implications for the <em>kind</em> of argument we might hope for
here.</p>
<p>For Kolodny, since democracy is necessary, in a strong sense, for
social equality, insofar as we have an interest in social equality, this
gives us a reason to prefer democracy over alternatives to democracy.
There is no need for an empirical argument to the effect that democracy
is, contingently, as things are here and now, the only available means
to avoiding social inequality. It is enough for social inequality, given
the nature of the political context, that there be differences in power
and de facto authority in the absence of certain dispositions. We can
know from the armchair that inequalities in political power and de facto
authority, in certain circumstances, suffice for and partly constitute
social inequality.</p>
<p>The examples above suggest that the case for democracy on the basis
of considerations of social inequality will depend, in large part, on
the empirical premise that inequalities in power and de facto authority
will be used to extract greater consideration for those with greater
power. Now, in my view, this empirical premise is very plausible. But to
establish it, we would need to do more than just reflect on hypothetical
examples. We would need to investigate the conditions which allow those
with greater power to extract greater consideration. It may well be that
there are ways of arranging society which would allow some to have
greater power and authority without thereby being in a position to
extract greater power. Then our argument would not necessarily support
democracy. But it is plausible to think that, given the significance of
political power, and the importance of political decisions—something
highlighted by Kolodny’s focus on finality, force, and
involuntariness—the temptation to extract greater consideration would be
too great to resist, and that, unless we were not to relate to each
other in society at all, greater consideration could easily be extracted
from those with less power by those with more power.<a href="#fn26"

<li id="fn5"><p>I am not claiming that there can be no non-instrumental
justification of democracy at all. Thomas Christiano’s account of the
relation between democracy and equality may avoid my criticisms, since
Christiano is not operating with an understanding of social equality
cast in terms of the notion of relating as equals. Christiano derives
his understanding of social equality directly from a deeper
understanding of moral equality understood in terms of equal
consideration of interests. See <span class="citation"

<li id="fn6"><p>This view thus has a similar structure to the theory of
justice and complex equality defended by Michael Walzer. But whereas
Walzer thinks that political power can easily be used to establish and
maintain inequalities in particular distributive spheres, and so might
upset complex equality <span class="citation"
data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">(Walzer 1983, 15)</span>, I am
claiming that it can easily be used to establish and maintain social
inequalities. Such a view could be thought of as the natural result of
combining Walzer’s claims in this context with David Miller’s
elaboration of Walzer’s position <span class="citation"
data-cites="Miller1995-ComplexEquality">(Miller 1995)</span>. The view
is also similar to Philip Pettit’s view of the relation between
domination and social inequality. I discuss Pettit’s position in Sect. 4

<li id="fn7"><p>The understanding of social equality in terms of
“relating as equals” is prevalent in the egalitarian literature. Miller
writes that equality “identifies a form of life in which people in a
very important sense treat one another as equals. In their social
intercourse, they act on the assumption that each person has an equal
standing that transcends particular inequalities (of achievement, for
instance)” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Miller1999-PrinciplesSocialJustice">Miller (1999)</span>
240). See also <span class="citation"
data-cites="Miller1993-EqualityMarketSocialism">(Miller 1993,
301–2)</span>. The preface of Walzer’s <em>Spheres of Justice</em> can
be read as a tour de force statement of this ideal of social equality.
Walzer writes: “the experience of subordination—of personal
subordination, above all—lies behind the vision of equality” (<span
class="citation" data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">Walzer
(1983)</span> xiii); “The aim of political egalitarianism is a society
free from domination” (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">Walzer (1983)</span> xiii) … “no
more bowing and scraping, fawning and toadying; no more fearful
trembling; no more high-and-mightiness; no more masters, no more slaves”
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">Walzer
(1983)</span> xiii). Walzer speaks of “a certain conception of how human
beings relate to one another and how they use the things they make to
shape their relations.” See <span class="citation"
data-cites="Walzer1984-SpheresJustice">(Walzer 1983 xiv)</span>.
Anderson writes “To be an egalitarian is to commend and promote a
society in which members interact as equals.” See <span class="citation"
data-cites="Anderson2017-PrivateGovernmentHow">(Anderson 2017,

relational egalitarianism rightly takes the idea that members of a
society must “relate to each other as equals” to be central to the
approach. See <span class="citation"
data-cites="Arneson2010-DemocraticEqualityRelating">(Arneson

social equality as relating as equals are <span class="citation"

<li id="fn11"><p>I will question whether there is an “obvious sense” in
which the ascetic warriors constitute a superior social stratum at the

appearance of social inequality here.<a href="#fnref11"

given by Anderson and Scheffler <span class="citation"

<li id="fn16"><p>Daniel Viehoff understands Kolodny’s argument in a
similar way. Of arguments like Kolodny’s, Viehoff writes: “[I]nequality
in power is (unless qualified in certain quite specific ways) itself
constitutive of social hierarchy, rather than being merely a causal
antecedent of certain hierarchical social relations” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Viehoff2019-PowerEquality">(Viehoff

relations as opposed to necessary and constitutive relations.<a

<li id="fn17"><p>I am not denying that asymmetries in power and
authority are never problematic. Of course, there are paradigm examples
of problematic power and authority, such as that of the kidnapper and
their victim. In such cases, however, the asymmetry seems to be
problematic because it allows those with greater power to interfere with
the basic freedoms of their victim and to invade their body and
property. I do not think that we are able to extrapolate from such
examples to the case of problematic inequalities in power at the
political level. If the state were to interfere in a person’s basic
freedoms, or to invade their body and property, that would be
problematic. It is the nature of state-subject relations that states
have great power over their subjects and that there is a danger that
this power might be used illegitimately. It seems to me that it is not
some having greater power of the state’s decision-making in such cases
that it problematic, but rather, the state’s interference that is
problematic.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn20"><p>This view might be thought to run into trouble with
false consciousness. But I think that such trouble can be avoided by
noting that even when one believes that greater consideration is due to

consideration.<a href="#fnref20" class="footnote-back"
