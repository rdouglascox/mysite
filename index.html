<p>I'm a philosopher based at the University of Sydney in
the Discipline of Philosophy in the School of
Humanities.</p>

<p>I work on a wide range of philosophical topics, but
specialise in the philosophy of mind, epistemology, the
philosophy of language, and political philosophy. </p>

<p>In the philosophy of mind and epistemology, I have
written on such topics as how we know our own reasons for
acting and how we know our own moral incapacities. In the
philosophy of language, I have written on topics related to
the syntax and semantics of why-interrogatives. In political
philosophy, I have written on the topic of the relationship
between democracy and social equality.</p>
