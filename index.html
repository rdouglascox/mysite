<p>
  I'm a philosopher based at the University of Sydney in the Discipline of
  Philosophy in the School of Humanities.
</p>

<p>
  I am interested in a wide range of philosophical topics, but tend to think and
  write about issues in political philosophy, the philosophy of mind, and the
  philosophy of language.
</p>

<p>
  In political philosophy, I have published work on educational justice, the
  relationship between democracy and social equality, and on questions related
  to political legitimacy and Indigenous justice. In the philosophy of mind, I
  have published on our knowledge of our own minds and our knowledge of our own
  reasons for acting and holding particular attitudes. In the philosophy of
  language, I have published on the syntax and semantics of why-questions.
</p>

<p>
  I have several research projects on the go. One on philosophical issues
  relating to educational justice. Another on the nature of political legitimacy
  and its application to Indigenous issues. And another on the nature of
  first-person thought and, more broadly, the role of perspectival thought in
  the humanities.

<p>
  I regularly teach two units at the University of Sydney, PHIL2635 Contemporary
  Political Philosophy and the July Intensive iteration of PHIL1012 Introductory
  Logic. I often teach into other courses, like PHIL1013 Society, Knowledge and
  Self, and PHIL3686 Core Issues in Practical Philosophy.

  I am currently the convenor of the University of Sydney Philosophy Seminar
  Series for which I maintain the following
  <a href="http://www.sydphil.wiki/">website</a>. Contact me if you are a
  philosopher passing through Sydney and would like to present something in the
  seminar series.
</p>

<p>
  I live in Sydney with
  <a href="https://www.luaraferracioli.com">my partner</a> and our three
  children.
