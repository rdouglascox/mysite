title: Pre-prints of several of my papers are now available on this site 
---

Pre-prints of several of my papers are now available on the [research
page](/research.html) of this site. Where possible, I have made both an .html
and a .pdf version of the paper available. Many of my papers are available
through open access. Where this is the case, I link directly to the journal's
version. Over time, I will make the remaining papers available as preprints.
