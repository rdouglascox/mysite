title: 'New Paper: Democracy and Social Equality'
---

My paper "Democracy and Social Equality" has now appeared at JESP. It is available here: [https://jesp.org/index.php/jesp/article/view/1890](https://jesp.org/index.php/jesp/article/view/1890). This is first of my new work in political philosophy. Thanks to the reviewers and editors at JESP for all their hard work bringing the paper to print.
