title: Civic Engagement in Australian Democracy 
---

A wonderful collection of essays on civic engagement in Australian democracy, edited by Lachlan Umbers and Sarah Murry is now available through the Anthem Press [here](https://anthempress.com/books/civic-engagement-in-australian-democracy-hb). (The collection contains a chapter from me "Reflections on the Voice Referendum".)
