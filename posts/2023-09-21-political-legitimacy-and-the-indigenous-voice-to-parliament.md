Here's the abstract:

> This essay sets out an argument from legitimacy for the proposed Indigenous
Voice to Parliament in Australia. The essay first sets out an understanding of
political legitimacy and of legitimacy deficits and argues that the Australian
Government faces a legitimacy deficit with respect to its exercise of political
power and authority over Indigenous Australians. The deficit arises, it is
argued, because Indigenous Australians face significant structural injustice
and there is little hope of redressing this injustice within the prevailing
governing conventions. The essay then argues that the proposed Indigenous Voice
to Parliament ought to be seen as part of a package to address this legitimacy
deficit by resetting the governing conventions of Australian society. The
argument from legitimacy is then compared favourably with more familiar
arguments from sovereignty and the right to self-determination.
