In July 2025, I will be starting a new role as Lecturer in Philosophy (Education Focused) in the Philosophy department at the University of Sydney. I am so excited and honoured to be joining such a wonderful department with so many wonderful colleagues permanently. I am looking forward to teaching into the new PPE program commencing in 2025.
