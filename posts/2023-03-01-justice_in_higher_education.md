title: 'Magazine Piece: "Justice in Higher Education"' 
--- 

I recently wrote something on justice in higher education for the new School of
Humanities Magazine at the University of Sydney. 

You can find the Sydney Humanaties Magazine [here](https://indd.adobe.com/view/9eafd712-4524-4661-b5df-740b30ffb3de). My piece starts on page 14.
