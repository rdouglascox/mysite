title: "SSSHARC Research Impact Accelerator 2024: Next Phase"

The SSSHARC research team that I am part of has officially secured internal funding to hold several workshops and produce a white paper on the topic of early childhood education and care policy. The first workshop will coincide with several other events on the topic of Children, Families, and Social Justice, being held as part of Luara Ferracioli's DECRA grant here at the University of Sydney in late July.
