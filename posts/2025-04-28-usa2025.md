title: "Pacific APA and Manuscript Workshop at UC Davis"
---

I just returned from a short trip to the USA where I attended the Pacific APA in San Francisco and participated in a manuscript workshop at UC Davis on a draft of a book on educational justice I am working on. I received incredibly helpful feedback from all of the participants, Harry Brighouse, Hannah Tierney, Qiannan Li, Alejandro Naranjo Sandoval, and Luara Ferracioli. Thanks to all of these commentators. Thanks especially to Hannah Tierney for putting the workshop together. In the same week I also presented in the departmental seminar at UC Davis on the value of the humanities. Thanks to the audience at the seminar for their probing questions.
