<p>Are the limits on what we can do, morally speaking—our “moral
incapacities” as Bernard Williams calls them—imposed on us from within,
by reason itself, or from without, by something other than reason? Do
they perhaps have their source in the will, as opposed to reason? In
this essay, I argue for a theory of moral incapacity on which our moral
incapacities have their source in reason itself. The theory is defended
on the grounds that it provides the best explanation of our knowledge of
our own moral incapacities. I argue that just as an agent’s reflective
commitments play an essential role in the explanation of their knowledge
of their moral incapacities, they play an essential role in the
explanation of moral incapacities themselves. Since reflective
commitments are rational commitments, and rational commitments have
their source in reason, moral incapacities have their source in reason
itself. The theory of knowledge of moral incapacity offered in this
essay draws on elements of Richard Moran’s “deliberative” theory of
self-knowledge and elements of that theory are used to offer a theory of
moral incapacities which extends and improves on Bernard Williams’
“deliberative” theory of moral incapacities. The resulting theory is
then defended against objections and alternatives.</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>My topic in this essay is what Bernard Williams calls “moral
incapacity” <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams
1995)</span>. I propose to approach this topic by means of a closely
related topic, namely, <em>knowledge</em> of moral incapacity. I will
first introduce each topic, and then explain the connection between
them.</p>
<p>The topic of <em>moral incapacity</em> itself can be introduced by
examples. There are familiar examples from history, like Luther’s “I can
do no other, here I stand.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> There are examples from
literature, like the example of Huck Finn from Twain’s <em>Huckleberry
Finn</em> who cannot turn his friend Jim in to the authorities <span
class="citation" data-cites="taylor2001">(Taylor 2001, 59)</span>. And,
of course, there are examples from philosophy. Williams gives the
example of a man who cannot gossip to reporters about his wife’s
problems because he would find it “disloyal, shabby, etc” <span
class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 50)</span>
and Harry Frankfurt gives an example of a mother who cannot give up her
child for adoption <span class="citation"
data-cites="frankfurt1999ch9">(Frankfurt 1999, 111)</span>. On the face
of it, what characterises all of these cases is that an agent cannot do
something, in a perfectly ordinary sense of “cannot”, and their
incapacity bears some relation to the agents’ moral character <span
class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995,
46)</span>.</p>
<p>The related, but less familiar, topic of <em>knowledge of moral
incapacity</em> can be introduced by reflecting on a remarkable feature
of our knowledge of our moral incapacities, namely, that we seem to have
a distinctive way of knowing about our own moral incapacities: the way
we have of knowing about our own moral incapacities is distinct both
from the way we have of knowing other kinds of incapacities of our own
and of the way we have of knowing the incapacities, moral or otherwise,
of others. Williams has drawn attention to the fact that first-personal
conclusions of the form “I cannot <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>”, when they express moral
incapacities, may be deliberative conclusions, based not on evidence
that one cannot <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>, but on
practical considerations <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 47)</span>. The point here is
that one can reach conclusions about one’s own moral incapacities not by
reflecting on psychological evidence bearing on what one can or cannot
do, but by reflecting on reasons for and against performing the very
action in question. The contrast is with how one reaches conclusions
about other incapacities of one’s own and how one reaches conclusions
about the incapacities, whether moral or otherwise, of others. On the
face of it, then, our knowledge of our own moral incapacities appears to
be much like our knowledge of our own attitudes, in the general sense
that we seem to have a distinctive way of knowing about them and in the
specific sense that we seem to be able to reach conclusions about our
own moral incapacities and attitudes not by reflecting on things which
are evidence that we have the incapacities and attitudes in question but
by reflecting on reasons for and against performing the action and
having such attitudes. While this feature of Williams’s account has been
noted by commentators <span class="citation"
data-cites="van_den_beld1997 gaita1991 watson2002">(Van den Beld 1997,
527–28; Gaita 2004, 107; Watson 2002, 142)</span>, it has not received
significant attention, and the connection between this form of
self-knowledge and other forms of self-knowledge has not been drawn.</p>
<p>These two topics—<em>moral incapacity</em>, and <em>knowledge of
moral incapacity</em>—are related, since, if these observations about
knowledge of moral incapacity are correct, they put significant
constraints on a theory of moral incapacity. Moral incapacities must be
such than an agent can know their own moral incapacities by such a
distinctive means. It is a mark against a theory of moral incapacity if
it cannot explain this, and it is a mark in favour of a theory if it
can. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover, going in the other
direction, if these observations are correct, a general theory of
self-knowledge must be able to account for knowledge of moral
incapacities. It is a mark against a general theory of self-knowledge if
it cannot account for knowledge of moral incapacities, and it is a mark
in favour of a theory if it can.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> While my focus in this
essay will be on the first issue, much of what I say here is directly
relevant to general theories of self-knowledge and I will draw attention
to these connections throughout the essay without pursuing them in
detail.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> My aim, in this essay, then, will be
to leverage observations about <em>knowledge</em> of moral incapacity in
arguing for a particular theory of moral incapacity. More precisely, I
will use elements of Richard Moran’s “deliberative” theory of
self-knowledge to modify and extend elements of Williams’s
“deliberative” theory of moral incapacity and to offer an additional
argument for it.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I argue that Williams does not do
enough in his discussion to explain how it is that we can come to know
our moral incapacities by a distinctive means and so does not do enough
to defend his theory of moral incapacities. Using the notions of
“deliberative commitment” and “first-person authority” developed in
Moran’s theory, I offer an argument for a theory of moral incapacities
which improves on Williams’s theory and his arguments for it. Insofar as
Moran’s “deliberative” theory of self-knowledge is plausible as a
general theory of self-knowledge, we have good reasons for developing a
theory of knowledge of moral incapacity and a theory of moral incapacity
which draw on this theory. At the same time, to the extent that the
theory can explain the facts about knowledge of moral incapacity, this
lends support to Moran’s theory as a general theory of self-knowledge.<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="locating-the-topic"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Locating the Topic</h1>
<p>Williams initially locates the topic of moral incapacity by claiming
that it is “the kind of incapacity that is in question when we say of
someone, usually in commendation of him, that he could not act or was
not capable of acting in certain ways” and by claiming that moral
incapacities, unlike other incapacities, are closely related to “what
sort of person the agent is”, that is, to their character <span
class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 46)</span>.
Luther’s inability to do otherwise, Huck’s inability to turn Jim in, the
husband’s inability to gossip to reporters about his wife, and the
mother’s inability to give up her child, all seem to have these
features. They say something about the kind of agent each is, something
about their moral character.</p>
<p>Williams then notes that in thinking about moral incapacities we can
think about them in both their first-personal aspect and their
third-personal aspect.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In thinking about them in their
third-person aspect we note that claims about moral incapacity, claims
of the form ‘He cannot’, are not merely claims of deontic modality, but
are, like other claims about incapacity, claims of circumstantial
modality, are claims about ability. As Williams notes, ascriptions of
moral incapacities “are connected with prediction and understanding in
some of the ways that physical, and other psychological, incapacities
are. In particular, they sustain inferences of the form <em>esse ad
posse</em> and, significantly, <em>non posse ad non esse</em>” <span
class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995,
47)</span>.</p>
<p>It is in thinking about moral incapacities in their first-personal
aspect that we notice something remarkable about them, namely, that
first-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities may be the conclusion
of practical deliberation. As Williams puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a first-personal ‘I can’t’, which is connected with the
same kind of subject matter as third-person ascriptions of moral
incapacity, and is related to deliberation. The ‘I can’t’ may express
the conclusion of a deliberation: my practical question has been whether
to <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>, and after rehearsing the
moral and other reasons I come to the conclusion that I cannot <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>. <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 46)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will have more to say in a moment about what exactly Williams is
saying here about how we arrive at first-person ascriptions of moral
incapacity. For now, I just want to draw attention to how the
first-person and third-person aspects of moral incapacities are related.
We can think of Williams as making the following three <em>prima
facie</em> plausible claims about ascriptions of moral incapacities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Third-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities are ascriptions
of genuine incapacities or inabilities: they involve a kind of
circumstantial modality.</p></li>
<li><p>Third-personal ascriptions and first-personal ascriptions of
moral incapacities are about the same subject matter: they involve the
same sense of ‘cannot’.</p></li>
<li><p>First-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities can be arrived
at on the basis of practical deliberation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While each of these claims are prima facie plausible, their
combination amounts to something remarkable. If third-person ascriptions
of moral incapacities are ascriptions of genuine incapacities or
inabilities, and first-person ascriptions involve the same sense of
‘cannot’ and can be arrived at on the basis of practical deliberation,
then we have a distinctive way of arriving at ascriptions of genuine
incapacities or inabilities. Our knowledge of our own moral
incapacities—as genuine incapacities—is more like our knowledge of our
own attitudes and actions than it is of our knowledge of other
incapacities and our knowledge of the attitudes and actions of others.
If our knowledge of our own moral incapacities is distinctive in this
way, then this raises important questions about what moral incapacities
are.</p>
<p>We can think of Williams as attempting to offer a theory of moral
incapacities which vindicates all three of these claims. Indeed, he
writes in connection with (3) that “when we understand better what kind
of incapacity is in question here, we shall see that this is what we
should expect” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 48)</span>. Yet one might
think that this remarkable implication is a reason to reject at least
one of the claims: we cannot know facts about genuine incapacities on
the basis of practical deliberation. A sceptic might argue then, that we
should accept (1) and (2) and reject (3): since first-person ascriptions
are about genuine incapacities, they must, like ascriptions of other
kinds of incapacities, be based on similar kinds of evidence. Or they
might argue that we should accept (1) and (3) and reject (2): since
first-person ascriptions are not based on ordinary evidence, they cannot
be about the same subject matter as third-person ascriptions of moral
incapacities. Indeed, some theorists have questioned whether
first-person ascriptions involve the same sense of ‘cannot’ as third
person ascriptions <span class="citation"
data-cites="gaita1991 van_den_beld1997">(Gaita 2004, 107; Van den Beld
1997, 526)</span>. Williams is aware of the temptation here. He
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here someone will reach for the weapon of distinguishing senses, and
will speak of there being two or more senses of ‘cannot’, that which
signifies whatever rejection is embodied in the agent’s deliberation,
and that which expresses what one ‘literally’ cannot do. <span
class="citation" data-cites="williams1981">(Williams 1981,
127)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, to claim that there is a special sense of ‘cannot’
involved in first-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities conflicts
with the fact that third-personal and first-personal ascriptions seem to
involve the same sense of ‘cannot’. So if the sceptic wants to accept
(2) and (3), they must reject (1), and hold that third-person
ascriptions, contrary to appearances, do not ascribe genuine
incapacities, but ascribe something else.</p>
<p>I take it that what Williams says about (1) is enough to make it
initially plausible, and I assume that (2) is also independently
plausible. We are yet to see the motivation for (3)—the claim that
first-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities can be arrived at on
the basis of practical deliberation. In the next section, I clarify and
motivate (3).</p>
<p>We have now located the subject matter of a theory of moral
incapacities. Before turning to the issue of knowledge of moral
incapacities, I want to briefly remark on something else that Williams
says about the subject matter. Williams claims that one important way
that moral incapacities differ from other incapacities is that moral
incapacities, unlike the others are “related to what sort of person the
agent is…to his character” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 46)</span>, they are
“expressive of, or grounded in, the agent’s character or personal
dispositions” <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams
1995, 47)</span>. As we will see, they are, according to Williams,
particularly related to a person’s dispositions to deliberate in certain
ways. Now, it may seem that, in light of such remarks, we should expect
the notion of character to play a significant role in a theory of moral
incapacities. Williams rejects this suggestion, however. He writes: “I
do not intend the notion of ‘character’ itself to be explanatory in this
discussion; it helps, if at all, in locating what has to be explained
<span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995,
47)</span>. As Williams writes:”‘character’ does not contribute much to
the explanation of moral incapacity; perhaps, rather, if we can shed
light on moral incapacity we can shed some light on the idea of
‘character’."<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="knowledge-of-moral-incapacity"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Knowledge of Moral
Incapacity</h1>
<p>Consider Williams’ claim about first-personal ascriptions of moral
incapacities being arrived at on the basis of practical deliberation
again: "‘I can’t’ may express the conclusion of a deliberation: my
practical question has been whether to <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>, and after rehearsing the moral
and other reasons I come to the conclusion that I cannot <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span> <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 48)</span>. Now consider an
example to illustrate it. I may be deliberating about what to do to
improve my essay on moral incapacities, and when the option of including
a student’s idea on the topic in my essay unacknowledged comes up, I
immediately conclude that I cannot do it. Now, it is important to
distinguish two distinct but closely related versions of this example.
In one version, I do not seriously consider including the student’s idea
as an option and I simply arrive at the conclusion in the course of
deliberation that I cannot do it. In another version, I may initially be
able to consider it as an option, but may not in the end be able to
choose to do it: in the course of deliberation I may recognise that it
has a certain feature which means that I cannot treat it as a serious
option and may then conclude that I simply cannot do it.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
Either way, my conclusion is a <em>deliberative</em> conclusion—a
conclusion arrived at on the basis of practical deliberation,
deliberation which involves considering reasons for and against various
options. It is <em>not</em> the conclusion of a more theoretical kind of
deliberation about what I am capable of doing, a kind of deliberation
which would seek evidence for what I am capable of. As Williams
writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The deliberative conclusion is based, as decisions are, on
considerations of the good, the useful, the obligatory and so on, and
not on psychological information about myself, which is presumably what
I would need in order to have a basis for ascribing an incapacity to
myself. <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995,
48)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In arriving at the conclusion that I cannot include my student’s idea
unacknowledged, I do not consider psychological information about
myself, about what kind of person I am, about my motivations, and so on.
Rather my conclusion is based on considerations of the good, the useful,
and the obligatory, or, in other words, it is based on the consideration
of reasons <em>for</em> and <em>against</em> doing the thing in
question, or reasons <em>for</em> and <em>against</em> treating doing
the thing in question as an option in deliberation. It may be based on
my recognition that including the idea unacknowledged would be a shabby
or deceitful thing to do, for instance.</p>
<p>We can discern in Williams’s remarks, then, several positive theses
about knowledge of moral incapacities and one negative one. The positive
theses are these: (i) the conclusion that I cannot do something may be
the conclusion of practical deliberation about whether to do the thing
in question (ii) and when it is, the conclusion is based on the
consideration of reasons for and against doing the thing in question or
on reasons for and against treating doing the thing in question as an
option in deliberation. The negative thesis is this: (iii) the
conclusion is <em>not</em> based on psychological information about
myself.</p>
<p>What is remarkable about Williams’s claims about knowledge of moral
incapacity, among other things, is the similarity they bear to remarks
about other kinds of self-knowledge. Analogous claims have been made
about knowledge of our actions and attitudes. Many theorists claim that
our knowledge of our future actions is not based on psychological
information about ourselves, but is, rather, based on considerations of
reasons for and against performing the action in question <span
class="citation" data-cites="hampshire_and_hart1958">(Hampshire and Hart

based on psychological information about ourselves, but is, rather,
based on reasons for and against having those attitudes. In the case of
belief, for example, it has been claimed that our knowledge of our own
beliefs is based not on psychological evidence about ourselves but
evidence for the truth of the propositions we believe <span
class="citation"

parlance, questions about our own actions and attitudes are
<em>transparent</em> to questions about the world <span class="citation"
data-cites="edgley1969 Moran2001">(Edgley 1969; Moran 2001)</span>.</p>
<p>For our purposes the analogy with knowledge of action is the most
useful. Such knowledge is thought to be both <em>immediate</em> and to
exhibit a kind of <em>transparency</em>. As Moran writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] person <em>may</em> have a purely predictive basis for knowing
what he will do, but in the normal situation of free action it is on the
basis of his decision that he knows what he is about to do. In deciding
what to do, his gaze is directed “outward,” on the considerations in
favor of some course of action, on what he has most reason to do. Thus
his stance towards the question, “What am I going to do now?” is
transparent to a question about what he <em>is to</em> do, answered by
the “outward-looking” consideration of what is good, desirable, or
feasible to do. <span class="citation" data-cites="Moran2001">(Moran
2001, 105)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the question of what I am going to do might be said to be
transparent to the question of what <em>I am to do</em>. And to answer
the latter question I must consider reasons for and against acting. In
this sense, the question of what I am going to do is, at least in part,
<em>transparent</em> to a question about the world. Williams’s
observation about knowledge of moral incapacity is analogous: the
question of what I <em>can</em> and <em>cannot</em> do, is, in some
sense, and to some degree, transparent to a question about the world. As
Williams writes in the context of conclusions about moral incapacity:
“[t]he thought that leads to them … is not for the most part thought
about oneself, but thought about the world and one’s circumstances”
<span class="citation" data-cites="williams1981">(Williams 1981,
130)</span>. So, to put Williams’s observations in the contemporary
parlance: knowledge of moral incapacity is both <em>immediate</em> and
exhibits a kind of <em>transparency</em>—it is immediate in the sense
that it is not based on evidence or observation, and it is transparent
in the sense that answering questions about moral incapacities often
involves answering a question about the world.</p>
<p>Now, these observations about immediate and transparent
self-knowledge raise a challenge: how could it be possible to answer a
question about one subject-matter—for example, our future actions or our
attitudes—by considering reasons which bear on a question about another
subject matter: the good, the useful, the obligatory, the true, the
desirable, and so on? As we will see in a moment, this challenge is a
version of what is known as the two-topics problem for transparency
theories of self-knowledge. A theory of self-knowledge would have to
give an account of how this is possible. In a prescient remark, Williams
raises exactly this issue: “[T]hough it needs to be understood in
philosophy, [it] is not a paradox: it must be true, not only of
practical reasoning but more generally, that one finds out about oneself
by thinking about the world that exists independently of oneself” <span
class="citation" data-cites="williams1981">(Williams 1981, 130)</span>.
While it is no paradox, the question remains just <em>how</em> it could
be true that one “finds out about oneself” in this way.</p>
<p>My aim in the next section is to introduce a theory of self-knowledge
which is able to explain these observations about transparency and
self-knowledge. Since the theory is—arguably—independently motivated as
an explanation of other kinds of self-knowledge, the fact that it can
offer an explanation of knowledge or moral incapacity, lends further
support to the claim that our knowledge of our own moral incapacities is
special in the way that Williams claims that it is.</p>

Incapacities</h1>
<p>In the previous section I argued that knowledge of moral incapacities
is like knowledge or our actions and attitudes in that it is both
<em>immediate</em> and exhibits a kind of <em>transparency</em>. While
many contemporary theories of self-knowledge take the immediacy of
self-knowledge to be the central explanandum of a theory of
self-knowledge, theories differ in the importance they assign to the
transparency observation.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Some theories downplay
the significance of the observation, while others make it central to the
theory of self-knowledge. I will draw on a theory of self-knowledge
which makes the transparency observation central to self-knowledge,
namely, Moran’s “deliberative” theory of self-knowledge. In this section
I will briefly explicate Moran’s theory, drawing attention to the
elements of his theory which will be central to explaining knowledge of
moral incapacities and which I will draw on in developing a theory of
moral incapacities.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="moran-on-transparent-self-knowledge"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Moran on Transparent
Self-Knowledge</h2>
<p>A crucial element of Moran’s explanation of the immediacy and
transparency of self-knowledge is the distinction between theoretical
and deliberative questions. The distinction can be brought out, albeit
imperfectly, by opposing interrogative forms like “Do I believe that
Jane runs?”, “Do I intend to go to the party?”, “Am I afraid of
John?”—all of which intuitively express <em>theoretical</em>
questions—with interrogative forms like “Am I to believe that Jane
runs?”, “Am I to go to the party?”, and “Am I to be afraid of John?”—all
of which intuitively express corresponding <em>deliberative</em>
questions.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> This intuitive difference
corresponds to a psychological difference in the way the questions are
answered: a theoretical question is “answered [merely] by discovery of
the fact of which one was ignorant” and is “a response to ignorance of
some antecedent fact about oneself” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Moran2001">(Moran 2001, 58)</span> whereas, in contrast, a
deliberative question is “answered by a <em>decision</em> or
<em>commitment</em> of some sort” and is “not [merely] a response to
ignorance of some antecedent fact about oneself” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Moran2001">(Moran 2001, 58, my emphasis)</span>. One takes a
<em>deliberative</em> stance towards the question of whether one
believes, say, that Jane runs, when one lets one’s answer to this
question be fixed by one’s answer to the corresponding deliberative
question, that is, the question of whether one is to believe that Jane
runs.</p>
<p>According to Moran, in the case of belief, “[what] transparency
requires is the deferral of the theoretical question”What do I believe?"
to the deliberative question “What am I to believe?” and, in turn,
“answering a deliberative question is a matter of determining what is
true” <span class="citation" data-cites="Moran2001">(Moran 2001,
63)</span>. To defer the theoretical question “What do I believe” to the
deliberative question “What am I to believe?” is to take a deliberative
stance towards the question. One then answers the question “What am I to
believe?” by determining what is true. It is important to recognise that
Moran’s explanation of transparency has a two-part structure. First, the
theoretical question is deferred to the deliberative question. And then
the deliberative question is answered, in the case of belief, by
considering factors bearing on the truth of the belief. For Moran, then,
“transparency is grounded in the deferral of theoretical reflection on
one’s state of mind to <em>deliberative reflection</em> about it” <span
class="citation" data-cites="moran2004precis">(Moran 2004, 424, my
emphasis)</span>. As I will argue below, the two-part structure of
Moran’s theory is essential to explaining knowledge of moral
incapacities.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>But how can it be legitimate to answer a question about one subject
matter (one’s state of mind) as if it were a question about a wholly
distinct subject matter (about the mind-independent world)? This is the
two-topics problem for transparency theories of self-knowledge. Moran’s
answer is that it is legitimate because what one’s attitude <em>is</em>
is, partly, if not entirely, rationally determined by the conclusion of
deliberative reflection. This is a modest sense in which we can be said
to have a kind of agency or first-person authority with respect to our
attitudes. Insofar as our attitudes are rationally determined by our
answers to deliberative questions, we can be said to have a kind of
agency or <em>first-person authority</em> over our attitudes. As Moran
writes: “A person is credited with first-person authority when we take
the question of what he <em>does</em> believe to be settled by his
decision as to what he <em>is to</em> believe” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Moran2001">(Moran 2001, 134)</span>. That is, a person is
credited with first-person authority when the question of what attitude
he has is settled by his decision or commitment arrived at by
deliberative reflection. When someone is committed to a particular
answer to a deliberative question, we can call this a <em>deliberative
commitment</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> To the extent that our attitudes
and actions are rationally determined by our deliberative commitments,
we can be said to have first-person authority over our attitudes and

deliberative commitment and first-person authority provide a solution to
the two-topics problem.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2"
id="a-transparency-theory-of-knowledge-of-moral-incapacities"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> A Transparency Theory of
Knowledge of Moral Incapacities</h2>
<p>Moran’s account of self-knowledge can be extended in a
straightforward way to provide an account of knowledge of moral
incapacities. We saw earlier that the theoretical question “Am I capable
of <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>-ing?” is transparent to
questions about the good the useful and the obligatory. So, for
instance, the man in Williams’ example might answer the question “Am I
capable of having a friendly and relaxed conversation with the lover of
my spouse?” by considering whether it would be a shaming, dishonest,
lax, or grotty thing to do <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 49)</span>. However, in order
to mirror the two-part structure of Moran’s theory we must find the
deliberative question that the theoretical question "Am I capable of
<span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>-ing? is deferred to, and
which, in turn is answered by considering certain features of <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>-ing itself. The deliberative
question here cannot be whether to <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>, for that would not distinguish
questions about what I <em>can</em> do from questions about what I am
doing or what I will do. Moreover, there’s an important sense in which,
at least in many central cases, being morally incapable of <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>-ing means that one will
<em>not</em> deliberate seriously about whether to <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>. I want to suggest, then that the
relevant deliberative question is the question of whether to treat <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>-ing <em>as an option</em> in
deliberation. One can address <em>this</em> question without
deliberating about whether to <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>, without entertaining it as a
serious option.</p>
<p>So, it seems that in the case of moral incapacities, the question of
whether one is capable of doing something is, at least in part,
transparent to the question of whether one is to treat doing the thing
in question as an option: am I to even treat this as an option? But how
can it be possible to answer a question about one subject matter—-in
this case, what one is capable of doing—by considering reasons which
bear on a question with a distinct subject matter—in this case, whether
doing the thing in question or treating it as an option would be a
shaming, dishonest, lax, or grotty thing to do. We saw that it was a
crucial part of Moran’s explanation that this would be a legitimate
thing to do only if one had a kind of first-person authority here, where
one has first-person authority insofar as one’s attitude is determined
by one’s answer to the <em>deliberative question</em>, by one’s
<em>deliberative commitment</em>. One has first-person authority over
one’s beliefs insofar as one’s belief is determined by one’s answer to
the deliberative question of what to believe. Similarly, then, one has
first-person authority over one’s deliberative options insofar as one’s
deliberative options are determined by one’s answer to the deliberative
question of whether to treat some option as an option, and to answer the
deliberative question one must reflect on certain features of one’s
action, whether it would be a shaming, dishonest, lax, or grotty thing
to do.</p>
<p>If this is correct, then we have an argument for the striking
conclusion that we have such first-person authority over our
deliberative options—what we can and cannot do—when these are moral
capacities and incapacities are partly rationally determined by our
deliberative commitments. If we take Williams’ observations about
knowledge of moral incapacity as facts which a theory of knowledge of
moral incapacity must explain, and we take Moran’s theory to provide the
best explanation of this observation, and that theory requires us to
assume that we have a kind of first-person authority over our
deliberative options, then we have an argument for the conclusion that
we have such authority over what we can and cannot do.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="an-objection-and-a-clarification"><span
class="header-section-number">4.3</span> An Objection and a
Clarification</h2>
<p>I want to end this discussion of knowledge of moral incapacity by
briefly discussing a common line of objection to transparency based
theories like Moran’s. Addressing this objection will allow me to
clarify the central notion of a deliberative commitment in the theory.
The response to this objection developed here will then be applied to a
structurally similar objection raised to Williams’s theory of moral
incapacities later in the paper.</p>
<p>The line of objection concerns cases of self-knowledge where it is
not plausible to claim that one engages in deliberation on outward
directed questions and cases where one has some attitude but not for any
particular reason.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> It may seem as though Moran’s
account cannot explain how we arrive at self-knowledge in such cases.
Moran has responded to this line of objection, and I think that his
response is basically correct.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> It is true that
Moran’s theory is best motivated by examples where there is some
deliberation about the outward directed question, but it should not be
assumed that such deliberation is essential to the theory. What is
essential is taking the deliberative stance towards a question about
one’s own attitudes: one lets one’s answer to this question be fixed by
one’s answer to the deliberative question. Now, in many cases, one will
have to “make up one’s mind” on the deliberative question before one can
arrive at an answer to the theoretical question. But in other cases,
one’s mind will already be made up on the deliberative question. And in
other cases still, the deliberative question will be answered one way or
another and it doesn’t even make sense to speak of making up one’s mind
with respect to the question. What matters is that one’s mind
<em>is</em> made up on the deliberative question, that the deliberative
question is answered one way or another, that one <em>has</em> a
deliberative commitment. It is <em>this</em> which allows one to answer
the theoretical question by taking a deliberative stance towards it. It
is the lack of a settled answer to the deliberative question which
explains cases where one is alienated from one’s attitude, and cannot
answer the theoretical question about it by taking a deliberative stance
towards the question. In many cases where one’s mind is already made up
on some deliberative question, it will not make sense to speak of one’s
mind being made up for any particular reason. The question may be so
central to one’s overall system of attitudes that the deliberative
question simply cannot come up. As Moran insists, in such cases, it may
nonetheless be true that what one’s attitudes are is determined, insofar
as one is rational, by one’s answer to the corresponding deliberative
questions, by one’s deliberative commitments.<a href="#fn17"

<h1 data-number="5" id="a-theory-of-moral-incapacities"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> A Theory of Moral
Incapacities</h1>
<p>Having argued that our knowledge of moral incapacities has the
features Williams claims it has, and having sketched a theory which
vindicates these claims, we have completed our case for (3)—the claim
that first-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities can be arrived at
on the basis of practical deliberation, in a way that is both immediate
and exhibits a kind of transparency. The question now is whether we can
provide a theory of moral incapacities on which they can be known by
this distinctive means <em>and</em> which vindicates (1) and (2)—the
claim that third-personal ascriptions are ascriptions of genuine
incapacities and the claim that third-personal ascriptions and
first-personal ascriptions are about the same subject matter
respectively. I will now argue that we can.</p>
<p>Let us begin by asking: what must moral incapacities be such that we
are able to know them on the basis of practical deliberation—that is, on
the basis of considering reasons for and against performing particular
actions, or for and against treating some option as an option in
deliberation? In light of the conclusion of the previous section, it
seems that any answer to this question will have to accommodate the fact
that moral incapacities are the kind of thing we have a certain degree
of first-person authority over. In this section, I present Williams’s
own theory of moral incapacities and argue that his theory does not
adequately explain how it is possible to know our moral incapacities on
the basis of practical deliberation. I then offer a theory of moral
incapacities which improves on Williams’s in this respect, drawing on
elements of the discussion of the previous sections.</p>
<p>Williams himself takes the task of giving a theory of moral
incapacities to be that of distinguishing moral incapacities from other
kinds of incapacities, including physical incapacities and other
psychological incapacities. Williams begins this task by noting that “A
moral incapacity belongs to the species: incapacity to do a certain
thing knowingly” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 48)</span>. According to
Williams, this distinguishes moral incapacities from physical
incapacities and many psychological incapacities. However, this is not
enough to distinguish moral incapacities from certain kinds of merely
psychological incapacities. As Williams says: “[o]ther incapacities…take
the form of one’s being unable to <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span> if one knows that one is <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>-ing” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 49)</span>. Williams goes on:
“These might include such things as walking a narrow plank over the Avon
gorge; having a relaxed and friendly conversation with the lover of
one’s spouse; and eating a roast rat” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 49)</span>. So Williams then
considers the suggestion that the cases might be distinguished in terms
of trying. In the case of moral incapacity, there is a sense in which if
I were to try, I might succeed, whereas in the cases of mere
psychological incapacity, if I were to try I will not succeed. Disgust,
for instance, will prevent me from eating the roast rat. The suggestion
is that “moral incapacity consists in the agent’s not being able (even)
to try” <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995,
49)</span>. But, of course, this will not do, since in the other cases
the agent may not even be able to try: disgust, for instance, may
prevent me from even trying to eat the roast rat.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>It is at this point that Williams makes the central move of his
discussion. He writes that “To understand moral incapacity, we have to
consider more closely the way in which the incapacity is connected with
the agent’s reasons” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 50)</span>. Williams claims
that, “there is a difference between moral incapacity and the others,
which is to be found in the way in which the agent’s incapacity is
connected to the mode in which the action presents itself to him; there
is a corresponding difference in the way in which he discovers that he
cannot <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span> ‘through’ imagining
<span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span>-ing” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 50)</span>. So there are two
differences to be found here. The first difference, according to
Williams, is that, in the case of a moral incapacity, “the fact that an
act would be (in my view) disloyal or shabby is a consideration <em>for
me</em> in deciding not to do it”. He notes that the fact that eating a
roast rat would be disgusting <em>could</em> be a reason for him, but
when it explains his incapacity, it doesn’t explain it in the same way.
I take Williams’s point here to be that, in the case of eating a roast
rat, the fact that it would be disgusting may, along with knowledge I
have about myself, lead me to conclude that I cannot eat the roast rat.
And then “the question of deciding not to do it will not come up”. Or,
perhaps if I nonetheless think that it is something I can do, and I do
decide to try, “the incapacity will make me fail”. It is not something I
can do knowingly. So, in these cases, the fact that it is disgusting is
a reason, but not a decisive reason <em>for me</em> in deciding not to
do it even though I might discover that I cannot do it through
imagining. In contrast, in the case of moral incapacity, the
consideration is a reason for me, and the way I discover that I cannot
do it through imagining is different: “In the case of moral incapacity,
my deliberative conclusion not to do the act, reached on the basis of
these totally decisive considerations, just is the conclusion that I
cannot do it” <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams
1995, 51)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, what do these remarks amount to? Well, they do not amount to a
<em>theory</em> of moral incapacity of the sort that we are looking for.
They only further specify the differences in how an agent arrives at
conclusions about what they can and cannot do. These remarks simply
explore in more detail the observation that we can arrive at knowledge
of moral incapacities by considering reasons which bear on deliberative
questions, like the question of what to do, or whether to treat some
option as an option in deliberation. Other psychological incapacities
cannot be known this way. One finds out that one cannot eat roast rat on
the basis of the kind of evidence that one would use in finding out that
someone else cannot eat roast rat.</p>
<p>Williams, does, however, go on to make some suggestive remarks about
the connection between practical deliberation and moral incapacities. In
particular, he writes that “the idea of a possible deliberation by the
agent in such terms gives us the best picture of what the incapacity is”
and “[w]e understand the agent’s moral incapacity just because we
understand how ‘I can’t’ could be the conclusion of his deliberation”
<span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995,
51)</span>. But we need to understand not only how ‘I can’t’ could be
the conclusion of practical deliberation, but how it could be a way of
coming to <em>know</em> that one cannot do the thing in question. We
face the two-topics problem: how could it be <em>legitimate</em> to
reach such a conclusion on the basis of practical deliberation? And we
have seen that an answer to this question must appeal to something like
first-person authority. At best, we get from Williams’s discussion the
claim that certain dispositions of the agent are the grounds of the
agent’s incapacities, and that these dispositions are, roughly,
dispositions to treat certain considerations as grounds for concluding
that one cannot do the thing in question, they are dispositions to
deliberate in certain ways. Thus Williams writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he dispositions that are the ground of the agent’s incapacities
are focussed on to a particular case through the way in which the
features of the case impress themselves on the agent—ways that are best
represented by a deliberation, even though the deliberation need not
consciously occur. <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1995">(Williams 1995, 52)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But to be told that there are certain dispositions to reason or
deliberate in certain ways which are the grounds of an agent’s
incapacity is only to be told something very course-grained about moral
incapacities. True, it may suffice to distinguish moral incapacities
from other kinds of incapacities—so it may suffice for Williams’s
purposes. But it leaves us without an answer to the two-topics
problem.</p>
<p>It is here that I think we can do better than Williams and offer a
more fine-grained theory of moral incapacity, one which solves the
puzzle about knowledge of moral incapacities, and which relates moral
incapacities to deliberation in the way that Williams wants to. To do
so, we need to clarify the nature of the dispositions involved in
arriving at the deliberative conclusion. We can better understand these
dispositions by seeing them as dispositions to treat certain
considerations as resolving particular deliberative questions and to
thereby arrive at a kind of deliberative commitment on the matter—that
is, a commitment to a particular answer to the deliberative question.
The deliberative question for the agent is whether to treat some option
as an option in deliberation. Can I include my student’s idea in my
essay unacknowledged? Am I to even treat it as an option, something to
include in my deliberation about what to do? Is the fact that it would
be a shabby thing to do a reason for me to not even consider it? In
answering such deliberative questions, the agent arrives at a decision
or commitment of some sort. I decide not to treat including my student’s
idea in my essay unacknowledged as an option, I arrive at a deliberative
commitment to not treat it as an option in my deliberation about what to
do. So we must see the dispositions involved as dispositions of
deliberative reflection and as closely tied to the notion of
deliberative questions. And in doing so we see that the dispositions
involved in explaining moral incapacities are just like those
dispositions involved in answering deliberative questions about our
actions and attitudes more broadly.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to see that it is not so much the relation
to deliberation here that matters but an agent’s answer to particular
deliberative questions about which options to treat as options and which
considerations to treat as reasons for ruling certain options out. An
agent may be committed to ruling some option out, or treating some
consideration as a reason for ruling some option out without having
explicitly deliberated about it. When the question of whether she can do
the thing in question arises for her, she might simply avow an answer
which is in line with her commitments or she may engage in deliberation
about whether to treat some option as an option or whether to treat some
consideration as a reason. Thus we capture the sense in which
“deliberation need not consciously occur”. And here we see how moral
incapacities can be tied to “the sort of person the agent is”, to their
character. For what an agent is committed to treating as a deliberative
option and as a reason for treating an option as an option tells us a
lot about the kind of person the agent is. As Williams says, it tells us
a lot about a person that they would even treat an option as an option.
Someone who does not treat the suffering of others as a reason for not
even treating options which would lead to the suffering of others as an
option, and, say, weighs the pros and cons of the option, may already
appear diminished in our eyes.</p>
<p>The crucial element in this explanation is the notion of an agent’s
commitment to a particular answer to a deliberative question, the notion
of a deliberative commitment. This element is what is missing in
Williams’s account. To speak merely of dispositions to deliberate is to
obscure the fact that what underlies these dispositions is a kind of
deliberative commitment, a commitment which reflects the agent’s view of
the reasons for and against treating some option as an option in
deliberation. It also leaves it somewhat obscure as to how these
dispositions might ground knowledge of moral incapacities. By appealing
instead to deliberative commitments, which are elements in the
explanation of other forms of self-knowledge, we can help ourselves to a
unified explanation of knowledge of moral incapacity and other kinds of
self-knowledge. Insofar as our deliberative commitments have a kind of
authority over the elements of our psychic life they concern, we can be
said to have first-person authority over those elements, and can come to
know those elements by reflection on reasons bearing on having them. It
is because deliberative commitments on the truth of particular
propositions have authority over what we believe that we can come to
know what we believe by considering evidence bearing on the truth of the
propositions believed. Likewise, it is because deliberative commitments
on the good, useful, and the obligatory, have authority over which
options are available to us that we can come to know what we can and
cannot do by considering questions about the good, the useful, and the
obligatory.</p>
<p>Now, I want to end my case for this theory of moral incapacities by
noting how it can be appealed to explain a central feature of moral
incapacities. An early statement of the idea of a moral incapacity
occurs in Williams’ “Critique of Utilitarianism”. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be a feature of a man’s moral outlook that he regarded
certain courses of action as unthinkable, in the sense that he would not
entertain the idea of doing them: and the witness to that might, in many
cases, be that they simply would not come into his head. Entertaining
certain alternatives, regarding them indeed as <em>alternatives</em>, is
itself something that he regards as dishonourable or morally absurd.
<span class="citation" data-cites="smart_and_williams1973">(Smart and
Williams 1973, 92)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want a theory of moral incapacities which can explain this
feature: that certain options will simply not come into the agent’s
head, that an agent may simply not regard them as options. We can
explain this in terms of an agent’s deliberative commitments, where the
more central of these can be thought of as partly constitutive of their
moral character. A man’s “moral outlook” will be partly constituted by
his deliberative commitments, which concern which options he is willing
to treat as options in deliberation. Insofar as he is committed to not
treating certain options as options in deliberation certain courses of
action simply won’t come into his head and will not be treated as
serious options in his deliberation or if they do, he will immediately
recognise that the option is of a kind that he is generally committed to
not treating as a deliberative option.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="objections-and-alternatives"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Objections and Alternatives</h1>
<p>In this final section, I will examine two objections and alternatives
to the theory of moral incapacities I have just defended. I begin by
addressing an objection to the role played by reason in the theory of
moral incapacity just offered. I then address the objection of the
skeptic who holds that the theory given cannot vindicate the claim that
third-personal ascriptions and third-personal ascriptions of moral
incapacities are about the same subject matter.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="brute-incapacities"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> <em>Brute
Incapacities</em></h2>
<p>Craig Taylor has argued that the case of Huck Finn raises a challenge
to theories of moral incapacities like Williams’s. Huck Finn, you will
recall, is incapable of turning his friend Jim in to the authorities.
This appears to be a paradigmatic example of a moral incapacity—Huck’s
incapacity has its source in his moral agency or character. Taylor
argues that this example raises a problem for Williams’s account. For,
Williams appears to be committed to holding that Huck must be disposed
to reason to the conclusion “I cannot turn Jim in” from reasons that he
has for not turning Jim in. That is, on Williams’s view, Huck’s moral
incapacity must be grounded in such a disposition. Yet, Taylor argues,
it is implausible to think that Huck has such a disposition. Taylor
wants to suggest that the case of Huck Finn is a case where the
incapacity is “a primitive fact about him” and “cannot be explained in
terms of some deliberation over his dispositions and commitments” <span
class="citation" data-cites="taylor2001">(Taylor 2001, 59)</span>. Why
should we think this? Taylor asks us to consider the
justification-seeking why-question “Why can’t you turn Jim in?” directed
at Huck. He suggests that answers like “I promised to help Jim” and “Jim
has been a good friend to me” or even “It is the only decent thing” will
not do, for “the point of the story is that for Huck such considerations
do not even count here as reasons for action (or inaction)—not, that is
to say, in the case of such a slave” <span class="citation"
data-cites="taylor2001">(Taylor 2001, 60–61)</span>. This, indeed, is
the standard philosophical upshot of this case: Huck does not think of
these considerations <em>as</em> reasons <span class="citation"
data-cites="bennett1974">(Bennett 1974)</span>. Since Huck does not
think of these considerations <em>as</em> reasons, he simply cannot be
disposed to reason from them to the conclusion that he cannot turn Jim
in, according to Taylor. His incapacity, therefore, cannot be explained
in terms of such a disposition.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this example raises a serious problem for theories
like the theory offered in the previous section. We seem to have an
example where the agent has a moral incapacity but is not disposed to
deliberate in the way that Williams claims they must be, and who lacks
the kind of deliberative commitment we have appealed to in our version
of the theory. How might we respond? There are two lines of response we
might develop.</p>
<p>The first line of response challenges Taylor’s reasoning about the
example. Taylor argues from the assumption that Huck does not think of
some consideration <em>as</em> a reason to the conclusion that the
consideration cannot <em>be</em> Huck’s reason for reaching the relevant
deliberative conclusion. But we may reject this line of reasoning by
pointing out that there are many cases where an agent draws a
conclusion, and acts, for a reason which they do not see <em>as</em> a
reason. There is a general distinction between what an agent believes to
be a reason in the normative sense, and an agent’s reasons for acting
<span class="citation" data-cites="Alvarez2010">(Alvarez 2010)</span>.
Huck’s reason for not turning Jim in may well be that Jim is his friend
<em>even though</em> Huck does not think of the fact that Jim is his
friend <em>as</em> a reason, in the normative sense, for not turning him
in. This is not to say that the fact that Jim is his friend is merely an
explanatory reason for Huck’s not turning Jim in—it may genuinely be
<em>his</em> reason for not turning Jim in, in the sense of being an
agent’s reason. That an agent’s reasons and an agent’s beliefs about
normative reasons can come apart like this has been convincingly argued
by Kieran Setiya <span class="citation" data-cites="SetiyaRWR">(Setiya
2007, 36–38)</span>. So, if we take this line of response, then we may
reject Taylor’s premise and hold that Huck is, nonetheless, disposed to
deliberate as Williams claims even though he does not believe that the
consideration from which he may conclude that he cannot do the thing in
question is a reason against doing it. The plausibility of this line of
response comes down to how plausible it is to think that Huck might
reply to the justification seeking why-question with an answer like the
following: “The reason why I cannot turn Jim in is that he is my friend,
even though I do not think that this is a reason for not turning him in
at all, and think that I in fact have every reason to turn him in!”.</p>
<p>The second line of response is to question the assumption that the
deliberative conclusion must always be drawn from a distinct premise at
all. Williams’s way of presenting the deliberative dispositions
certainly suggests as much, but we might resist the suggestion. As we
saw earlier, in response to a common line of objection to transparency
theories of self-knowledge, it is possible to hold that someone might
have a deliberative commitment, that is, they may be committed to a
particular answer to a deliberative question, for no particular reason.
The commitment may be so central to one’s overall system of attitudes
and commitments that it does not make sense to speak of it being held
for a particular reason. Indeed, it must often be the case that one is
committed to the truth of particular propositions for no particular
reason at all. I may be committed to the truth of the proposition that I
was born, although I do not believe this for any particular reason. And,
as Anscombe has argued, it must sometimes be the case that we act
intentionally for no reason at all, where the correct answer to the
justification seeking why-question is “no reason” <span class="citation"
data-cites="AnscombeI">(Anscombe 1963, 25–28)</span>. But in both cases,
there is an important difference between being deliberatively committed
to some belief or action for no reason, and not being so committed. The
former brings with it a kind of answerability or responsibility to
reason: insofar as one is so committed one exercises a kind of rational
authority over what one believes and what one does which one would not
if one were not so committed. Were new reasons bearing on your belief or
action to come to light, you would be responsible for revising your
commitment. According to this line of response then, Taylor’s reasoning
gives us no grounds for doubting that Huck is not deliberatively
committed to rejecting the option of turning Jim in. We have no grounds
for thinking that the deliberative question of whether to treat turning
Jim in as an option, is not negatively resolved for Huck. Indeed, it is
quite plausible that many cases of moral incapacities involve the mere
recognition that a particular option falls under a general description
where one already has a deliberative commitment against treating options
which fall under that description as options in deliberation. In such
cases the agent may not have any further reason for not treating the
option as an option, and the deliberation that takes place in resolving
the specific deliberative question may take a very attenuated form.<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>That one or the other of these lines of response (or both) must be on
the right track can be brought out by raising a challenge for Taylor’s
alternative. Whatever else we say about Huck’s case, it still seems
plausible to say that Huck will be in a position to know that he cannot
turn Jim in in a way that does not require him to infer this from
evidence about himself. So our claim about the epistemology of moral
incapacity holds good in this case, whatever we think about Huck’s
reasons and dispositions to deliberate. But if this is so, then we
should be motivated to treat this case as like other cases where the
agent does have a reason for ruling the relevant option out. And we can
appeal here to the common factor of the agent having resolved the
deliberative question, having reached a deliberative commitment here, in
order to explain their ability to know their moral incapacities in both
cases. In claiming that Huck’s incapacity is a brute psychological fact
about him, Taylor leaves himself with no way of explaining the
distinctive means by which Huck can come to know that he cannot turn Jim
in.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="a-special-sense-of-cannot"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> <em>A Special Sense of
‘Cannot’</em></h2>
<p>I noted earlier that there is a temptation to argue from Claim 3, the
claim about first-person ascriptions of moral incapacities to either the
falsity of (1) or (2). The basic idea here is that the sense of ‘cannot’
involved in the first-person deliberative conclusion either expresses a
kind of deontic modality or a special kind of circumstantial modality
tied to rationality and the weight of reasons—‘I can’t rationally do it,
the reasons against it are too strong’.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>I will argue that although Williams’s argument against this kind of
scepticism is inconclusive, there is an argument available to show that
the third-person and first-person senses are the same and that they do
not express a special kind of circumstantial modality. I will then argue
that the theory of moral incapacities I have defended can vindicate this
claim.</p>
<p>In his discussion of this kind of scepticism, Williams assumes that
the sceptic must be claiming that the special sense of ‘cannot’ involved
in the first-person deliberative conclusion expresses a kind of deontic
modality. His case against the sceptic, so conceived, is strong. He
first makes the point about the implications of third-person ascriptions
and then, rather enigmatically writes: “‘Can’t’ is, once again, ‘can’t’,
and it has the same sort of implications as it does in the third-person
cases for the question whether the world will contain my doing the thing
in question” <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1995">(Williams
1995, 48)</span>. But this is something that the sceptic who holds that
the first-personal ‘I can’t’ expresses a special kind of circumstantial
modality can concede. They might hold that the sense of ‘cannot’ which
‘signifies whatever rejection is embodied in the agent’s deliberation’
<em>does</em> express something an agent cannot literally do, but in a
distinct circumstantial sense of ‘cannot’, one tied to rationality and
the weight of reasons.</p>
<p>I suspect that this is exactly the kind of position held by those who
are committed to what Williams calls the “boring answer” to the question
of what moral incapacities are and what its co-relative, practical
necessity, is. Williams writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That question might have had only a rather boring answer: for
instance, that <em>must</em> is selected when the preferred course of
action is very markedly favoured over the others, or the weight of
reasons overwhelmingly comes down on one side. <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1981">(Williams 1981, 126)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar point applies in the case of moral incapacities. Perhaps ‘I
cannot’ is selected when the weight of reasons overwhelmingly comes down
against the option in question. There may well be a circumstantial sense
of ‘cannot’ corresponding to such cases. We needn’t think that the ‘I
cannot’ is deontic. Perhaps there is a sense in which the agent is
unable to do the thing in question when the reasons are so strongly
against it. Why couldn’t the boring answer be right in such a case?</p>
<p>It is at this point that we can draw on considerations from our
discussion of knowledge of moral incapacity in presenting an argument
against the boring answer and the view that the sense of ‘cannot’
involved in first-person ascriptions of moral incapacities is tied to
cases were one has overwhelming reasons against some option. As Williams
points out, in cases like these “a set of objectives or constraints is
merely taken for granted, and relative to them, a particular course of
action is very clearly singled out” <span class="citation"
data-cites="williams1981">(Williams 1981, 126)</span>. What this
suggests is that in such cases the deliberative question the agent faces
is this: “What shall I do?”, where the deliberative options are taken as
fixed and she is to choose between them. Now, the sceptic we are arguing
against agrees that the first-personal ascription ‘I cannot’ is arrived
at on the basis of deliberation, that is, by a distinctive means. If so,
then we can think of the agent as arriving at the conclusion ‘I cannot’
by answering the deliberative question of what she is to do. Now here is
the problem for this suggestion. It is by answering the deliberative
question of what she is to do that the agent answers the question of
what she <em>will</em> or <em>will not</em> do. We saw this suggestion
earlier in the discussion of knowledge of action. What would entitle her
to the stronger conclusion in this case, namely that she <em>cannot</em>
do the thing in question, when the deliberative question she is
answering is whether <em>to do</em> the thing in question? Answering
<em>this</em> deliberative question, and arriving at a corresponding
commitment, <em>at best</em> supports the conclusion that she <em>will
not</em> do the thing in question. In order to arrive at a stronger
conclusion she must answer a different deliberative question. But then
if the deliberative question is whether to treat some option as an
option, then she is no longer deliberating against a background of
options she takes for granted and weighing reasons for and against them,
so the conclusion she reaches cannot merely be one which reflects the
fact that she cannot do the thing in question because she has
overwhelming reasons against doing it, it must be one which reflects the
fact that she has taken some reason as a reason for ruling some option
out, for answering the deliberative question of whether to treat that
option as an option, and has thereby arrived at a deliberative
commitment of sorts.</p>
<p>If this argument is correct, then even if there is a sense of
‘cannot’ which corresponds to an agent being unable to do something in
the face of overwhelming reasons, this is not the sense of ‘cannot’
involved in first-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities, and the
sceptic has no grounds for objecting to the claim that first-personal
and third-personal ascriptions of moral incapacities are about the same
subject matter.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>In my view, it is a mark against Frankfurt’s theory of
moral incapacity that it cannot explain knowledge of moral incapacities.
To make the case for this claim would require a careful explication of
Frankfurt’s position and an examination of alternative explanations of
knowledge of moral incapacity which I am not able to undertake here. In
short, the difficulty for Frankfurt’s position stems from Frankfurt’s
insistence that moral incapacities are a volitional matter and that the
volitional states involved in moral incapacities in no way depend on an
agent’s reasons. (See <span class="citation"
data-cites="frankfurt2002a">Frankfurt (2002)</span> p. 219). This
effectively rules out an appeal to the kind of transparency based
theories of self-knowledge considered in this essay. See <span

1998a)</span>.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>There is debate over how general a theory of
self-knowledge must be. See (<span class="citation"
data-cites="finkelstein2003">Finkelstein (2003)</span> p. 162; <span
class="citation" data-cites="bar-on2004">Bar-On (2004)</span> p. 144;

pp. 140–141; <span class="citation" data-cites="Byrne2011">Byrne
(2011b)</span> pp. 212–214]. That debate is mainly concerned with
whether a theory of self-knowledge must be general with respect to
knowledge of sensory—perceptual states and other phenomenally conscious
states—and non-sensory states—attitudes. I am not claiming that a theory
of self-knowledge must be fully general. But it would be a mark in
favour of a theory if it could be general with respect to knowledge of
our attitudes and knowledge of moral incapacity. And I focus on this
case here. There is a growing literature concerning just how far
transparency accounts of self-knowledge can be applied. See, for
instance, <span class="citation"

<li id="fn4"><p>As the discussion to follow will make clear, so-called
transparency theories of self-knowledge are best placed to account for
knowledge of moral incapacity. I take this to be a mark in their favour.
For transparency theories, see <span class="citation"
data-cites="evans1982">Evans (1982)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Moran2001">Moran (2001)</span>, <span class="citation"

href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>I focus on Moran’s theory since, as I will argue, it has
a feature that other transparency theories of self-knowledge lack and
which is crucial for explaining knowledge of moral incapacity.<a
href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>There are many critics of Moran’s “deliberative”
transparency theory. Some are critical of transparency theories in
general. See, for instance, <span class="citation"
data-cites="finkelstein2003 bar-on2004 Way:2007aa Lawlor:2009aa gertler2011 paul2014 Cassam2015">(Finkelstein
2003; Bar-On 2004; Way 2007; Lawlor 2009; Gertler 2011; Paul 2014;
Cassam 2015)</span>) Others are critical of Moran’s particular version
of the transparency theory. See, for instance, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Byrne2018TransparencySelfKnowledge">(Byrne 2018)</span>. If
these critics reject Moran’s theory, then they must either reject the
observations I make in the text about knowledge of moral incapacities or
find an alternative and better explanation of knowledge of moral
incapacities. I take it to be a significant mark in favour of Moran’s
particular version of the transparency theory that it can so
straightforwardly explain knowledge of moral incapacities. Others have
developed transparency theories which are largely sympathetic to Moran’s
theory but which modify it in certain ways. See <span class="citation"
data-cites="boyle2009 BoyleM BoyleTSK boyle2019 hieronymi2006 Hieronymi2009-TwoKindsAgency">(Boyle
2009, 2011a, 2011b, 2019; Hieronymi 2006; Hieronymi 2009 )</span>.
Insofar as these theories are structurally similar to Moran’s view they
may also be extended to explain knowledge of moral incapacities. Further
work would need to be done to compare the relative advantages and
disadvantages of these theories.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Not all moral incapacities have both a first-personal
and a third-personal aspect. As Williams notes, there are cases were
someone is incapable of doing something simply because an action of the
relevant kind is not part of their practical vocabulary. In such cases,
we may be able to say in the third person that the agent is incapable of
doing the thing in question. But that thought will obviously be
unavailable to them since they are unable to think of the action at all.
Following Williams, I focus here on incapacities which have both a
first-personal and a third-personal aspect. See <span class="citation"

<li id="fn10"><p>Ryle famously rejected immediate as an explanandum for
a theory of self-knowledge. Recent theories which have rejected the

<li id="fn11"><p>Critics of Moran’s view often characterise deliberative
questions as normative questions like “Should I go to the party” or
“Ought I to go to the party” <span class="citation"
data-cites="finkelstein2003 Cassam2015">(Finkelstein 2003; Cassam
2015)</span>. Moran is explicit that this is not his position <span
class="citation" data-cites="Moran2001">(Moran 2001, 145)</span>. In
terms of the psychological contrast about to be drawn in the text, a
deliberative question is answered by a decision or commitment of some
sort, whereas a normative question is answered by arriving merely at a
judgement, belief or evaluation.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Critics of Moran’s theory often overlook the two-part
structure of Moran’s explanation and attribute to him the view that one
simply answers the question “Do I believe that Jane runs?” by answering
the question of whether Jane runs. Some say that on Moran’s view one
takes a deliberative stance to the question “Do I believe that Jane
runs?” just when one answers it by answering the question of whether
Jane runs. See, for instance, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Byrne2005">(Byrne 2005)</span>. But this is not so as the
text makes clear. Some alternative transparency theories of
self-knowledge replace the two-part structure of Moran’s theory with a
one-part structure. See, for instance, <span class="citation"

<li id="fn13"><p>I use ‘deliberative commitment’ in a stipulative sense
to refer to the state of being committed to an answer to a deliberative
question. It is standard in the literature on commitment to think of
commitments as a species of intention. See, for instance, <span
class="citation" data-cites="Calhoun2009-WhatGoodIs">(Calhoun 2009,
615)</span>. I suspect that in the case of action deliberative
commitment in my sense and deliberative commitment in this sense
coincide. Indeed, an intention can be thought of as an answer to a
question about what to do. For a view of this kind, see <span
class="citation"
data-cites="hieronymi2006 Hieronymi2009-TwoKindsAgency">(Hieronymi 2006,
2009)</span>. However, since there are deliberative questions about
belief and emotion, I do not think that deliberative commitments are a
species of intention. If anything, intentions are a species of
deliberative commitment. See <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcgeer1996">(McGeer 1996)</span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcgeer2008">(McGeer 2008)</span> for development of a theory
of self-knowledge which involves yet another sense of commitment.<a

<li id="fn14"><p>None of this is to say that our agency or authority is
perfect. It may well be that although we have reached a positive answer
to a deliberative question, we lack the corresponding belief. Moreover,
we may posses a particular belief while not being committed to a

<li id="fn19"><p>A similar thing can be said in response to the
objection to Moran’s transparency theory that there is no deliberation
involved in answering the question “Do you believe that there are
bicycles on Mars?”. Insofar as one is committed to a negative answer to
the question of their being bicycles anywhere else but on Earth, one
simple applies one’s more general deliberative commitment to the
specific deliberative question about whether there are bicycles on Mars.
Notice that in such a case it would be hard to provide a particular
reason for believing that there are no bicycles on Mars in answer to the
question “Why do you believe that there are no bicycles on Mars?” None
of this does anything to show that one is not deliberatively committed
to a negative answer to the deliberative question of whether one is to
believe that there are no bicycles on Mars. It just shows how little
cognitive effort is involved in a deliberative question being resolved
for one and how it doesn’t always make sense to request a reason for
belief in cases of deliberative commitment.<a href="#fnref19"
