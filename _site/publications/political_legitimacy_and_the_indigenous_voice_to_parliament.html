<p>This essay sets out an argument from legitimacy for the proposed
Indigenous Voice to Parliament in Australia. The essay first sets out an
understanding of political legitimacy and of legitimacy deficits and
argues that the Australian Government faces a legitimacy deficit with
respect to its exercise of political power and authority over Indigenous
Australians. The deficit arises, it is argued, because Indigenous
Australians face significant structural injustice and there is little
hope of redressing this injustice within the prevailing governing
conventions. The essay then argues that the proposed Indigenous Voice to
Parliament ought to be seen as part of a package to address this
legitimacy deficit by resetting the governing conventions of Australian
society. The argument from legitimacy is then compared favourably with
more familiar arguments from sovereignty and the right to
self-determination.</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Since 1788, successive governments in Australia have claimed to have
the <em>right</em> to exercise political power and authority over
Indigenous Australians.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, in light of the history of
Australian settlement, it is not unreasonable to doubt that any of these
governments have <em>ever</em> had a fully legitimate claim to exercise
such power and authority over Indigenous Australians. Indeed, it is not
unreasonable to doubt that the Australian Government has a fully
legitimate claim to exercise political power and authority over
Indigenous Australians today, even if one does not think that the
history of Australian settlement calls this seriously into question.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This is because the basic structure
of Australian society systematically disadvantages Indigenous
Australians along various and complex dimensions <em>and</em> there are
no reasonable prospects of redress within the prevailing governing
conventions of Australian society. It is in the context of these two
considerations, and their bearing on the question of political
legitimacy, that we ought to view the package of proposed amendments to
the governing conventions of Australian society, a package which
includes the proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Or
so I shall argue.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In what follows, I show how these considerations establish that the
Australian Government faces a <em>legitimacy deficit</em> with respect
to its claim to have the right to exercise power and authority over
Indigenous Australians. I then show how the proposed Voice can be seen
as part of a package of proposals to change the governing conventions of
Australian society to rectify this legitimacy deficit. I take this
<em>argument from legitimacy</em> to provide a sufficient case for the
proposed Voice. An important feature of the argument is that it appeals
only to facts about the Australian Government and its ability to address
the systematic injustice faced by Indigenous Australians today. These
facts are sufficient to establish that the Australian Government faces a
legitimacy deficit which must be addressed, and which can be addressed,
I shall argue, by adopting the proposed Voice. The argument from
legitimacy, as presented in this paper, while providing a sufficient
justification for the proposed Voice, can be bolstered by an appeal to
claims about collective rights to self-determination and Indigenous
sovereignty. However, as I shall argue, it has several advantages over
more familiar direct and indirect arguments for the proposed Voice which
appeal to Indigenous sovereignty and collective rights to
self-determination.</p>
<p>Before presenting the argument, it will be helpful to be clear about
what the proposed Voice to Parliament is being taken to be. The proposal
itself, which is a proposal to enshrine a Aboriginal and Torres Straight
Islander Voice in the Australian Constitution, will be put to the
Australian people in a referendum.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> While many of the
details of the Voice to Parliament will be left to Parliament to decide,
the proposal is for an “Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander Voice”,
an advisory body that will “make representations to the Parliament and
Executive Government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to
Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander peoples”<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. As
an advisory body, the proposed Voice will give independent advice to the
Parliament and Executive Government.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> It will not have a veto
power. For the purposes of the argument of this paper, it will be
assumed that what we are seeking an argument for, is the proposed Voice
as an advisory body. In terms to be explained below, the assumption is
that the proposed Voice will provide Indigenous Australians,
collectively, with, at the very least, a greater degree of <em>absolute
contributory influence</em> over certain decisions than they currently
have.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="the-argument-from-legitimacy"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> The Argument from Legitimacy</h1>
<p>Whether a regime which claims to have the right to exercise political
power and authority over a certain group of people does <em>in fact</em>
have such a right, depends on whether the regime meets the <em>basic
legitimation demand</em> with respect to that group or not.<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> The basic legitimation demand arises
whenever some claim to have the right to exercise such authority and
power over others <span class="citation"
data-cites="Williams:2005aa">(Williams 2005, 6)</span>. Successive
governments in Australia have claimed to have the right to exercise
power and authority over Indigenous Australians. Thus, the basic
legitimation demand has been raised with respect to Indigenous
Australians.</p>
<p>Meeting the basic legitimation demand, once it is raised, requires
that an acceptable justification of the exercise of political power and
authority be given to everyone over whom it is being claimed to be
rightfully exercised <span class="citation"
data-cites="Williams:2005aa Larmore:2018aa">(Williams 2005, 4; Larmore
2018, 37)</span>. What counts as an acceptable justification will
largely be a matter of what makes sense as a legitimation of political
power in light of the beliefs and values of those who are to accept the
justification.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Philosophical theories of
legitimacy differ with respect to how closely they tie acceptability to
the actual beliefs and values of the governed, whether they take the
acceptability of a regime in light of the non-coercively formed beliefs
and values of the governed, to be both necessary and sufficient for the
basic legitimation demand being met, or whether they impose further
conditions on the demand being met—for instance, that the beliefs and
values be reasonable and publicly defensible or that the justification
appeal to principles that all members of society can see reason to
endorse.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Nonetheless, there is a growing
consensus that what counts as an acceptable justification must be
tightly linked to <em>actual</em> beliefs and values, and not beliefs
and values the governed would have under extreme idealisation.<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> As Philip Pettit writes:
“Legitimacy is the ideal, under a natural formulation, of having a
social order that is imposed only insofar as it satisfies terms that
people actually endorse” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Pettit:2012aa">(Pettit 2012, 144)</span>. This difference
among theories will not matter to the argument from legitimacy, for, as
we will see, questions about the prospects of the Australian
Government’s meeting the basic legitimation demand are raised on almost
any plausible understanding of what it takes to meet the demand.</p>
<p>The situation of Indigenous Australians living under the Australian
Government <em>today</em> is one in which the legitimation demand has
been raised but has not been met. Such a situation is one in which the
right of a regime to exercise its de facto political power and authority
over certain groups of people—that is, its political legitimacy—is
called into question. It is one in which there is a <em>legitimacy
deficit</em>.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> The concept of a legitimacy deficit
is related to the ideas of the ends of government and the source of a
government’s authority. Governments are often justified, at least
partly, in terms of the ends they exist to attain. They are also often
justified in terms of the source of their authority. Modern societies
like Australia have all but settled the question of the source of the
authority of the government: its authority is given by the principle of
popular sovereignty. The history of colonial government in Australia in
the 19th century is a history of the triumph of this principle. No other
source of authority would make sense as a legitimation in light of the
prevailing values and beliefs of Australians. We will return to issues
around the principle of popular sovereignty below.</p>
<p>Governments are justified not merely in terms of the sources of
legitimate authority, however. They are also justified partly in terms
of the ends they exist to attain. Among the ends that governments exist
to attain, I will suggest, and which form part of the justification for
the exercise of power and authority is a securing certain degree of
social justice. I will have more to say about what I take the operative
conception of social justice to be in a society like Australia in a
moment. The concept of a legitimacy deficit is related to the idea of
the ends of government. As David Beetham writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A legitimacy deficit involving the ends or purposes of government…can
be described as an <em>inadequacy</em> or <em>incapacity</em> for the
constitutional rules to facilitate successful government performance, or
to provide resolution in the event of failure, whether the failure is
one of ineffectiveness or of partiality in respect of the ends that
government exists to attain.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Beetham:1991aa">(Beetham 1991, 207–8)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, a legitimacy deficit arises involving the ends of
government when the governing conventions of a society—the formal and
informal conventions concerning how government gets done in that
society—are incapable of achieving the ends of government.<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> An interesting consequence of this
conception is that a government can come to be unable to serve the ends
of government by virtue of the ends of government themselves changing.<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Where securing basic liberties and
pursuing the common good may have sufficed for the legitimacy of a
government in the past, securing some degree of (egalitarian) social
justice may now be required as an end of government.</p>
<p>If we reflect on the situation of Indigenous Australians living under
the Australian Government today, we see that the governing conventions
of Australian society are inadequate to its ends. The shared beliefs and
values of Australian society when it comes to the end of government are
not served by the current governing conventions. The basic legitimation
demand has been raised but has not been met. There is a legitimacy
deficit. This is partly due to raised expectations about the ends of
government, and, in particular, raised expectations about and changing
conceptions of social justice.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> The emerging
conception of social justice is a conception of social justice which
sees the equal satisfaction of basic human needs and some kind of
equality of opportunity to obtain other socially valuable goods, such as
education and work, as matters of social justice. On almost any remotely
plausible conception of social justice, it will be clear that the
circumstances of Indigenous Australians today are significantly unjust.
Significant differences in life expectancy, infant mortality, health and
disease outcomes, housing conditions, educational outcomes, occupational
status, income and wealth, between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
Australians all suggest, and in some cases may simply constitute,
injustice at work.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Recognising such injustice is only one half of the argument for the
claim that there is a legitimacy deficit, however. The argument must
also establish that the current governing conventions are inadequate,
that they are incapable of fully redressing the situation. This half of
the argument rests on a claim about the <em>source</em> and
<em>nature</em> of the social injustice in question and on how this is
related to the governing conventions of society—the formal and informal
conventions of government at all levels. The claim is that the source of
this injustice lies, in part, in the basic structure of society, in the
structure of its basic institutions, in the way that these institutions
interact with Indigenous Australians.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
We know that the cause of inequality is not merely a lack of resources,
as the failure of welfare programs demonstrates. The cause is partly
structural. As the Uluru Statement puts it: “These dimensions of our
crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem”. It is a
matter of how social institutions like the health care system and the
education system work, how they fail to be sensitive to differences in
cultural understandings of health and education.</p>
<p>It is crucial to the argument from legitimacy that we have an
adequate understanding of the nature and source of the injustice faced
by Indigenous Australians. It is crucial to establishing the claim that
the prevailing governing conventions are inadequate to the ends of
government <em>and</em> to establishing the claim that the proposed
Voice could be seen as a means of addressing the failings of the
prevailing governing conventions. What is it about the structural nature
of the injustice faced by Indigenous Australians which means that the
prevailing governing conventions are inadequate? How does the structural
nature of the injustice faced by Indigenous Australians differ from the
structural nature of the injustice faced by, say, women or people with a
disability in Australia?</p>
<p>Noel Pearson has helpfully characterised the predicament of
Indigenous Australians in terms of (i) the extreme minority status of
Indigenous Australians (ii) the history of settler colonialism, and
(iii) racism <span class="citation" data-cites="Pearson:2014aa">(Pearson
2014, 37–38)</span>. I want to set aside for the moment the extreme
minority status of Indigenous Australians.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
Pearson’s appeal to the history of settler colonialism and racism point
us in a promising direction when it comes to understanding the unique
nature of the structural injustice faced by Indigenous Australians. The
history of settler colonialism is a history of an attempt by the
dominant culture to impose itself on Indigenous Australians. It is a
history of attempted assimilation. The attempt has not succeeded, and
many Indigenous Australians have retained Indigenous identities and
connections with Indigenous cultures. Given the history of settler
colonialism, it is not surprising that many of the basic structures of
Australian society function, if not as a mechanism for imposing the
dominant culture, then, at least in ways that are not sensitive to
differences between minority and dominant cultures. The consequences of
such a lack of sensitivity are not merely consequences for culture, but
are often more substantive. They are consequences for educational
outcomes, health outcomes, and various related outcomes. What these
basic structures provide for, contemporary implicit and explicit racism
only exacerbates. To take just one example, an example linked to many
outcomes, consider the case of education. The ways that educational
institutions fail to be sensitive to features of Indigenous culture, and
the way implicit and explicit biases, only serve to exacerbate these
insensitivities, are well documented.<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
Now, the reason why the prevailing governing conventions are inadequate
to addressing this structural injustice is that the prevailing governing
conventions lack adequate mechanisms by means of which Indigenous
Australians can report on, or advise on, the ways, whether positive or
negative, that the basic institutions of society interact with their
Indigenous identities and cultures. Although the voice of those at the
receiving end of structural injustice need not be taken to be a decisive
factor in any decision-making about how to address such injustice, it is
clear that in the absence of such a voice, decision-making is likely to
have significant blind-spots. In the context of the history of settler
colonialism and continuing racial biases, the epistemic value of the
voice of those at the receiving end of disadvantage becomes significant.
A plausible diagnosis of why the prevailing governing conventions are
inadequate to addressing the structural injustice faced by Indigenous
Australians is that there is no mechanism within those conventions by
means of which this epistemically valuable voice can be heard.</p>
<p>It is an important feature of my argument that a failure to achieve
the ends of government with respect to social justice does not
<em>suffice</em> for a failure of legitimacy. While some theorists would
equate legitimacy and justice, seeing only one political distinction
where there are in fact two, I think it is important to distinguish
between the two. Governments are consistently failing to achieve their
ends, including the ends of justice. But this isn’t always a matter of
an inadequacy of the governing conventions. It may just be a failure of
governments operating within those conventions, or it may be a matter of
external contingencies, or there may be no better alternative
conventions available. And, moreover, the correct way to respond to such
failures may be to <em>work within</em> those conventions to achieve the
ends of government. This is what allows us to explain why there may be a
difference in <em>kind</em> and not merely a matter of <em>degree</em>
when it comes to the question of justice for women in Australia, and
justice for Indigenous Australians. Although it is not entirely
uncontroversial, my view is that the prevailing governing conventions of
Australian society <em>do</em> provide women with means of addressing
their structural disadvantage <em>within</em> those conventions.
Conventions of popular representation <em>do</em> seem to be able to be
leveraged in the direction of justice. Women are not an extreme
minority, and their influence on the political process is increasing.
Progress may be slow towards justice for women, but there is evidence
that there is progress. I think that the situation Indigenous
Australians face is different in <em>kind</em>. As we just saw, various
factors conspire to support the conclusion that the prevailing governing
conventions are inadequate: the extreme minority status of Indigenous
Australians, the history of settler colonialism, and racism.<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> I think that this difference in
<em>kind</em> makes for a significant normative difference: to be
subjected to the exercise of power and authority without full legitimacy
is to be, at least in part, <em>mastered</em> or <em>dominated</em> by
others. Not only is one significantly disadvantaged, but there is little
or no hope within the existing structures of power and authority for
redress. This is the true meaning of powerlessness. Hence the urgency
for change.</p>
<p>How might the Australian Government come to meet the basic
legitimation demand? How might it overcome the legitimacy deficit? Under
what conditions could it offer an acceptable justification to
<em>all</em> of those it claims to have a right to exercise power and
authority over? Only by changing the governing conventions, it seems,
will the Australian Government come to meet the basic legitimation
demand, for only then will it be able to offer an acceptable
justification of the exercise of its political power and authority to
everyone over whom it is exercised. It is in the context of this
situation that we should consider the proposal of an Indigenous Voice to
Parliament enshrined in the Australian Constitution and the broader
package of proposals made in the Uluru Statement. Such a proposal can be
seen as part of a package of proposals for resetting the governing
conventions of Australian society, a resetting of those conventions such
that there will be some reasonable hope for redress within the governing
conventions of society. As we just saw, one of the reasons why the
prevailing governing conventions are inadequate is that they lack a
mechanism by means of which an epistemically important voice can be
heard. We saw that it was due to the particular nature of the structural
injustice faced by Indigenous Australians that it is so important that
such a voice can be heard. The nature of this structural injustice is
illuminated by facts about the history of settler colonialism and
racism. It is for this reason that the proposed Voice may be uniquely
placed to address some of the structural disadvantage faced by
Indigenous Australians. Other solutions, such as more representation in
Parliament, or more sophisticated forms of consultation, would arguably
not get to the heart of the problem that we have identified. If this
diagnosis is correct, then an Indigenous Voice to Parliament enshrined
in the constitution would amount to a resetting of the governing
conventions of Australian society of the kind which may, together with
the implementation of other parts of the package of proposals, allow the
Australian Government to offer a justification <em>to</em> all
Australians of its exercise of political power and authority over them:
there may, under the revised circumstances, be a reasonable hope of
redress within the amended governing conventions of Australian
society.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>At this stage in the discussion, it is worth addressing a potential
objection. According to the objection, to suggest that there are shared
beliefs and values, or that there should be, may be to assume too much
and to adopt an imperialistic attitude towards legitimacy. Perhaps the
situation in which we find ourselves in modern societies is one in which
there is no system of shared beliefs and values, and perhaps to seek one
would lead to injustice being done to minority systems of shared beliefs
and values. The argument I have given may not recognise the gulf between
Indigenous beliefs and values and mainstream liberal egalitarian beliefs
and values. I have assumed that the project of answering the basic
legitimation demand is one of finding a way of justifying the governing
conventions of society in terms of broadly shared values and beliefs.
And I have suggested that, with a proposal like the Voice, this can be
done. Perhaps this is a mistake. Perhaps what is needed is that we find
governing conventions which can be justified in terms of a ‘plurality’
of prevailing systems of values and beliefs, or a ‘plurality of
normative orders’, where “a normative order is a cluster of values,
beliefs and legitimation ‘narratives’ (religious, cultural, moral,
political and legal) that people appeal to in order to justify (and
contest) the practices and institutions they are both subject to and
help constitute.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Ivison:2020aa">(Ivison 2020, 123)</span> If normative orders
are plural, then the question becomes: “on what basis can a liberal
political order be considered legitimate given this plurality?”<span
class="citation" data-cites="Ivison:2020aa">(Ivison 2020, 124)</span>
Perhaps what matters, then, is not that there might be a single system
of beliefs and values in light of which the basic legitimation demand
might be met, but that the basic structure of society can be justified
in light of each of the distinct normative orders prevailing within it.
This makes the prospects of legitimating something like a liberal
democratic state look rather dim. If the plural normative orders do not
contain significant overlap or are not subsumed under a broader
normative order, there may be little hope of agreement on a particular
form of government. A better way of thinking about the plurality of
normative orders, however, may be to see the project of meeting the
basic legitimation demand as one of finding a way to accommodate the
plurality of normative orders <em>within</em> society. This
understanding is suggested by Ivison when he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason why repeated attempts at ‘solving’ entrenched indigenous
disadvantage fail (measured almost exclusively in social welfare terms)
is because of the lack of political (and moral) attention accorded to
indigenous normative orders in the determination of law and policy. In
other words, <em>there has been insufficient attention paid to the
structural nature of the injustice underlying relations between settler
states and indigenous peoples</em>.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Ivison:2020aa">(Ivison 2020, 125, emphasis added)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this interpretation, as I understand it, the issue of the
plurality of normative orders only provides a further and deeper
explanation as to why we need to change our governing conventions if the
structural nature of the injustice faced by Indigenous Australians is to
be addressed: not only must the governing conventions be sensitive to
what are traditionally understood as cultural differences, but they must
also be sensitive to Indigenous normative orders. In this sense, then, I
take Ivison’s appeal to plural normative orders to offer a sophisticated
refinement of the argument from legitimacy offered above, one which
connects issues of structural injustice to the plurality of normative
orders. Moreover, as I shall argue below, Ivison’s account of the
plurality of normative orders might also help us to better understand
the role appeals to Indigenous sovereignty might play in justifying the
proposed Voice: Indigenous sovereignty can be understood (it need not
be) as a kind of non-political, spiritual and cultural authority,
grounded in relations to the land; and such a form of authority forms
part of a plurality of normative orders which must be respected under
government.</p>
<p>To summarise the discussion so far. I have argued that the proposed
Voice ought to be seen in the context of questions about political
legitimacy. I have argued that the Australian Government faces a
legitimacy deficit with respect to its claim to have a right to rule
over Indigenous Australians. And I have argued that the deficit may be
overcome by adopting the package of proposals which includes the Voice
to Parliament. It is fitting that the question should go to a referendum
and receive popular authorisation. Moreover, it is fitting that the
proposals should focus on changing the constitution, as the constitution
formally enshrines the governing conventions of a society, it formalises
what the governing conventions of a society are to be and set out how
government is to be done.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"

class="header-section-number">3</span> Arguments from Sovereignty and
the Right to Self-Determination</h1>
<p>It might be thought that if there is an argument for the proposed
Voice, then it must be an argument from sovereignty or from a right to
self-determination, and not an argument from legitimacy.<a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
The terms ‘sovereignty’ and ‘self-determination’ are the most commonly
appealed to normative terms of public debates over the Voice, and
‘legitimacy’ hardly makes an appearance. Moreover, the Uluru Statement
from the Heart makes several references to sovereignty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribes were the first
sovereign Nations of the Australian continent and its adjacent islands,
and possessed it under our own laws and customs….This sovereignty is
<em>a spiritual notion…. It has never been ceded or extinguished, and
co-exists with the sovereignty of the Crown</em>….With substantive
constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient
sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia’s
nationhood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument from legitimacy offered in the previous section appeals
neither to claims about sovereignty nor to collective rights to
self-determination. Might arguments from sovereignty or rights to
self-determination provide a better case for the proposed Voice? Might
such considerations bolster the argument from legitimacy? In this
section, I argue that, rather than providing independent or direct
arguments for the Voice, the arguments from unceded sovereignty and
self-determination appeal to considerations which are best accommodated
within the argument from legitimacy. I will begin with some
clarificatory remarks about the concepts of sovereignty and
self-determination.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>The concept of sovereignty is the concept of supreme or ultimate
power and authority with respect to some matter.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
Although the concept of sovereignty is a broad one, covering many
spheres of authority, theorists have tended to be concerned with a
particularly narrow conception of sovereignty, one tied to the supreme
or ultimate authority of modern nation states over their internal
matters. Since sovereignty is a right to supreme or ultimate power, it
is taken to confer a right of non-interference on the part of other
actors, and so is central to claims of political independence. Such a
conception has also been closely tied to a right to control a territory.
While this conception has been closely tied to the defence of the
supreme authority of the modern nation state, it can be adapted to any
political group. Characterising such a conception, Janna Thompson writes
that “‘sovereignty’ is the exercise by a people—whether a clan, a tribe
or a nation—of <em>control</em> over a particular territory through
their political and social institutions” <span class="citation"
data-cites="Thompson:1990aa">(Thompson 1990, 315)</span>. Call
conceptions like these <em>political conceptions</em> of sovereignty,
since they entail a right to supreme or ultimate political power or
authority (whether this is tied to a particular territory or not).</p>
<p>Such political conceptions of sovereignty are closely related to
certain conceptions of the collective right to self-determination and
self-government. As James Tully writes: “The principle or right of
self-determination is, on any plausible account of its contested
criteria, the right of a people to govern themselves by their own laws
and to exercise jurisdiction over their territories, either exclusively
or shared” <span class="citation" data-cites="Tully:2008aa">(Tully 2008,
285–86)</span>. Such a right to self-determination is at the heart of
the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), adopted
by the UN General Assembly in 2007.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Article 3 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indigenous peoples have a right to self-determination. By virtue of
that right they freely determine their political status and freely
pursue their economic, social and cultural development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The declaration understands the right to self-determination here as
grounding a right of Indigenous peoples to determine their political
status and a right of Indigenous peoples to freely pursue their
economic, social and cultural development. Article 4 connects the right
to self determination to the right to political autonomy and
self-government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indigenous peoples, in exercising their right to self-determination,
have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to
their internal and local affairs….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Articles 3 and 4 both seem to be committed to a stronger form of
political right than that proposed in Article 18: “Indigenous peoples
have the right to participate in decision-making in matters which would
affect their rights”, an article that comes close in wording to the many
of the justifications offered of the proposed Voice. Thus, for instance,
Megan Davis speaks of the right of Indigenous Peoples “to participate in
decisionmaking in matters that impact upon their lives.”<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Rather than attempt an exhaustive examination of the various
conceptions of sovereignty and self-determination here, I propose to
examine conceptions which are most likely to bear fruit as part of an
argument for the proposed Voice. In discussing these conceptions I will
draw on an important distinction from recent work in democratic theory.
The distinction is that between having <em>controlling influence</em>
over political decisions and having some degree of <em>contributory
influence</em> over decisions.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> A group has
controlling influence over some matter when it has decisive influence
over a range of decisions related to that matter—it is for that group to
<em>decide</em> the matter. Conceptions of sovereignty and
self-determination can be distinguished with respect to whether they
entail <em>extensive</em> controlling influence or whether they entail
<em>restricted</em> controlling influence. Historically, conceptions or
sovereignty and self-determination have been tied to the notion of
extensive controlling influence—this is just political autonomy or
self-government in the unrestricted sense. Sometimes claims for
Indigenous sovereignty or self-determination involve this extensive
conception. Sometimes it is claimed that such extensive control should
involve final authority, and is thus incompatible with the authority of
the state. Sometimes it is claimed that such extensive control is
compatible with the authority of the state. As Taiaiake Alfred writes in
a related context: “even those who advocate sovereignty as a goal seek
only a limited form of autonomy, not independence; the goal relates only
to powers of self-government within a framework of constitutional law
and authorities delegated by the state”.<a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>More recently, conceptions of sovereignty and self-determination have
focused on a right to restricted controlling influence. Patrick Macklem
writes, “[Indigenous] government involves more than the conferral of
special rights to engage in particular activities: It also involves
rights to <em>determine</em> how, when, where, and by whom such activity
can occur” <span class="citation" data-cites="Macklem:1993aa">(Macklem
1993, 1355 emphasis added)</span>. The model here is something like a
federal system. As Macklem writes: “within a federal system, levels of
government are sovereign within their respective spheres of authority”
<span class="citation" data-cites="Macklem:1993aa">(Macklem 1993,
1347)</span>. On such a model, different and potentially overlapping
groups may have controlling influence over different matters. I will
call these conceptions of political sovereignty and self-determination
<em>strong</em> political conceptions, and will contrast them with
<em>democratic</em> conceptions below. I take the latter, “coordinate”
model, on which different groups may be sovereignty with respect to
different spheres of authority in a coordinated system, to be the most
promising strong political conception of sovereignty, and the one of the
most fruitful for thinking about claims of Indigenous Sovereignty.</p>
<p>How might these strong conceptions of sovereignty and
self-determination be appealed to in arguments for the proposed Voice?
We can distinguish between direct and indirect arguments. Direct
arguments proceed as follows: Indigenous Australians have a right to
self-determination, understood as entailing a right to extensive or
restricted controlling influence; the proposed Voice would partly or
fully satisfy such a right. Indirect arguments proceed as follows:
Indigenous Australians have a right to self-determination, understood as
a right to extensive or restricted controlling influence; the proposed
Voice is an important first step or means to negotiating the conditions
for the satisfaction of such a right. Let us begin by considering the
plausibility of the shared first premise here.</p>
<p>What could justify the claim to a right to extensive or restricted
controlling influence on the part of Indigenous Australians? It could be
argued that this is the extensive right associated with historical
sovereignty and it has never been ceded or extinguished. This is the
historical route.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> I take it that the claim that
Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander tribes were the first sovereign
nations, in some strong sense, of the Australian continent and adjacent
islands to be a plausible one, and to be defensible on historical
evidence. I also think that a plausible case can be made for the claim
that such sovereignty was never ceded, or at least that it was not ceded
by many Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander tribes.<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
The more controversial question is whether such sovereignty, in the
political sense, has been extinguished, or whether only some weaker form
of sovereignty remains in place to today.<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
This is not a question I will take up here.<a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
It is worth noting, however, that to the extent that such claims to
unceded sovereignty are defensible, they will establish a claim to
sovereignty for distinct First Nations, and not for Indigenous
Australians as a collective, a consideration which is relevant to
arguments for a centralized Voice.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>A second line of justification appeals to the fact that the exercise
of controlling influence, either extensive, or restricted, may be
required for continuation of collective ways of life.<a href="#fn36"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
This is an instrumental kind of justification and it rests on two
claims. The first is that Indigenous Australians have a significant
interest in certain collective ways of life, an interest significant
enough to ground various duties on others with respect to that
interest.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> The second is that a certain degree
of controlling influence is a necessary means to protecting and
promoting that interest.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> I take the first of
these assumptions to be very plausible.<a href="#fn39"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>
The second assumption is a largely empirical assumption about the causal
relationship between controlling influence and the protection and
promotion of certain substantive interests. It is hard to say whether it
is controlling influence which is necessary here, or whether something
like a significant degree of contributory influence (a suggestion to be
discussed below) would be sufficient. I will not take a stand on this
matter. Rather, I want to consider how rights to extensive or restricted
controlling influence can be appealed to in argument for the proposed
Voice, provisionally granting that a right to controlling influence can
be justified.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the most important point to make in relation to proposed
Voice is this: at best the proposed Voice would give Indigenous
Australians, collectively, a significant degree of <em>absolute
contributory influence</em> over decisions affecting them. (Absolute
influence here contrasts with relative influence—how much influence one
has relative to others). It would not, in itself, give Indigenous
Australians the kind of controlling influence required for autonomy or
self-government understood as requiring extensive or restricted
controlling influence. Indigenous Australians would not have controlling
influence over such matters as they would still share influence over
such matters with other Australians. This, of course, is something that
the framers of the proposal were aware of. The Final Report of the
Referendum Council states that the Voice to Parliament “was considered
as a way by which the right to self-determination could be achieved.”
However, “There was a concern that the proposed body would have
insufficient power if its constitutional function was ‘advisory’
only”.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> The second premise in the direct
argument is simply false: the proposed Voice itself is not a
constitutive means of satisfying the right to either extensive or
controlling influence.</p>
<p>This said, it might be suggested that the proposed Voice could be
justified as a first step or means to achieving sovereignty in this
strong sense. Perhaps the proposed Voice is more likely than any
alternative to further the cause of Indigenous sovereignty, understood,
perhaps, in terms of the “coordinate” model above. This, in my view, is
the most promising form of argument from such a strong political
conception of sovereignty for the proposed Voice. It rests, however, on
a significant empirical assumption about proposed Voice being an
important first step or means towards Indigenous Sovereignty. It is
difficult to tell whether the proposed Voice is more likely to further
the cause of Indigenous sovereignty, understood, perhaps, in terms of
the coordinate model above, than the alternatives. Proponents of strong
forms of political sovereignty are sceptical that it will be. They see
the Voice as a part of a package which would make the pursuit of strong
forms of sovereignty less likely. As one sceptic, Michael Mansell,
writes: “The…proposal does not achieve self-determination. In fact it
cannot even be described as a step towards-self-determination” <span
class="citation" data-cites="Mansell:2016aa">(Mansell 2016, 53)</span>.
I do not want to take a stand here on the empirical question. I will
merely note that <em>if</em> a good case can be made for the proposed
Voice being a plausible means to achieving stronger forms of
sovereignty, <em>then</em> we would have an additional reason, over and
above that provided by the argument from legitimacy, for the proposed
Voice. The argument from legitimacy, nonetheless, has an advantage over
such an argument in that it does not rest on any such claim about what
the proposed Voice will be an important first step towards. The change
to the constitution which enshrines the Voice will itself address the
legitimacy deficit.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>So much for arguments for the voice from strong strong conceptions of
self-determination and sovereignty. Might arguments from weaker
conceptions of self-determination and sovereignty do better? Many
theorists and activists have attempted to develop more democratic
conceptions of self-determination and sovereignty.<a href="#fn43"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>
These conceptions have less of a focus on political autonomy and
self-government. These alternative conceptions are often developed in
terms of “democratic representation”, but I think that they are better
understood as claims for <em>a significant degree of absolute
contributory influence over decisions</em>. An argument from such a
weaker conception might do better than arguments from strong conceptions
in that the proposed Voice can plausibly be seen as a constitutive means
to achieving sovereignty on these weaker conceptions.</p>
<p>As I have said several times now, one thing the proposed Voice
promises to do it to give Indigenous Australians, collectively, greater
contributory influence over decisions affecting them <em>than they
currently have</em>. The proposed Voice promises to deliver is both
greater <em>absolute</em> contributory influence, and greater
<em>relative</em> contributory influence over certain decisions, for
Indigenous Australians, than they currently have. Now, there would be a
straightforward democratic argument for the Voice if it were the case,
as it plausibly is, that Indigenous Australians, individually, on
average, as a matter of fact, have <em>less</em> relative contributory
influence over certain political decisions than other Australians. Then
the proposed Voice could be justified merely on grounds of political
equality: it is needed to ensure that Indigenous Australians have equal
informal and formal influence over political decisions. This is a
powerful argument, but it needn’t appeal to anything like a right to
self-determination. It need only appeal to a certain conception of
democratic equality. It isn’t clear to me, however, that such a proposal
would go far enough. Achieving equality of informal influence will not
be enough to address the structural disadvantage faced by Indigenous
Australians and so will not be enough to address the legitimacy deficit.
Moreover, and this is a point I suspect proponents of the argument from
sovereignty would be keen to make: equality of informal influence would
not be enough to protect the common way of life of Indigenous
Australians. It is for this reason that I think that the proposed Voice
had better be seen as a mechanism for ensuring that Indigenous
Australians, collectively, have <em>much greater absolute contributory
influence</em> over decisions affecting them than they currently do. How
can such a proposal be justified?</p>
<p>As the discussion has now made clear, any argument for a right to
sovereignty or self-determination that is going to be relevant to
justifying the proposed Voice must establish a right to a significant
degree of absolute contributory influence. It need not establish a right
to controlling influence over certain matters. But it must establish
more than a right to equal relative influence. I suspect that such a
case can be made based on the claim that a significant degree of
absolute contributory influence is required for people to protect a
common way of life. This is what I take to be the truth in the arguments
from sovereignty and self-determination: that Indigenous Australians,
collectively, have a <em>prima facie</em> right to a significant degree
of absolute contributory influence over decisions affecting them. If so,
we have an independent and direct argument for the proposed Voice on our
hands. The proposed Voice can simply be seen as a constitutive means of
satisfying the right of Indigenous Australians to a significant degree
of absolute contributory influence over decisions affecting them.</p>
<p>Do these considerations provide a better argument for the proposed
Voice than those we have considered so far? Might there be a better way
of accommodating claims to sovereignty? I want to suggest that this
direct argument has a significant drawback when compared to the argument
from legitimacy: it justifies a departure from the democratic ideal of
equal informal influence over all decisions on the grounds that some
have an independent <em>right</em> to a significant degree of absolute
contributory influence over certain decisions. This is potentially in
conflict with the principle of popular sovereignty as a source of
legitimate authority. If the principle of popular sovereignty entails
anything, it entails that no individual or collective has an
<em>independent moral right or claim</em> to greater influence over
political decisions than any other individual or group.<a href="#fn44"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>
This is in tension with a collective <em>right</em> to a particular
degree of absolute controlling influence, since that degree may entail a
<em>right</em> to greater influence than others.<a href="#fn45"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>
Now, I am not saying that departures from the democratic ideal of equal
informal influence can never be justified. They must be justifiable if
the proposed Voice can be justified. My claim is that they cannot be
justified in terms of some having independent right or claim to greater
influence over decisions, without generating a significant tension with
the principle of popular sovereignty.<a href="#fn46"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>How might this tension be resolved? I want to suggest that it can
resolved by embedding considerations about the important of protecting a
common way of life —considerations which are appealed to in the
arguments from sovereignty and self-determination—<em>within</em> the
argument from legitimacy. Rather than argue for a <em>right</em> to a
significant degree of contributory influence, we instead think of a
failure to protect First Nations ways of life as among the injustices
the prevailing governing conventions are inadequate to address. The
right is a right to the protection of these ways of life and not to some
degree of political influence. The changes to the governing conventions
are then not justified on the basis of some independent moral right to
influence over political decisions—something inconsistent with the
justification for the principle of popular sovereignty—but rather as a
means to better serving the ends of government and redressing the
legitimacy deficit. In this way, the very considerations which motivate
the argument from sovereignty and self-determination can be seen to
bolster the argument from legitimacy.</p>
<p>I want to conclude the discussion by returning to the “spiritual”
notion of sovereignty mentioned earlier, a notion that “co-exists” with
the sovereignty of the Australian Government. One way for the relevant
notion to co-exist with the sovereignty of the Australian state would be
for it to involve an authority distinct from the political authority.<a
href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> On this view, sovereignty is not
seen as a claim to political authority as such. Rather, it is seen as a
right to supreme or final authority over certain matters, plausibly,
cultural and spiritual matters. Such a source of authority would
correspond to something like a normative order, in Ivison’s sense: “a
cluster of values, believes, and legitimation ‘narratives’ (religious,
cultural, moral, political and legal) that people appeal to in order to
justify (and contest) the practices and institutions they are both
subject to and help constitute.” These normative orders are a source of
authority but are not a source of political authority as traditionally
understood—they are not backed, for instance, by the apparatus of the
state. Although the orders are plural and overlapping, some may be
sovereign, in the sense of providing a kind of final or supreme
(non-political) authority on some matters. The Uluru Statement spells
out one such understanding of sovereignty when it speaks of “the
ancestral tie between the land, or ‘mother nature’, and the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were born therefrom, remain
attached thereto, and must one day return thither to be united with our
ancestors. This link is the basis of the ownership of the soil, or
better, of sovereignty.”<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>How might such an understanding of sovereignty relate to the argument
from legitimacy? Unlike on the previous understandings, sovereignty
itself is not understood as a right to a significant degree of
contributory influence over political decisions, and so does not
conflict with the justification of the principle of popular sovereignty.
Sovereignty, rather, is something that already exists, and must be
protected. In this sense, sovereignty can be seen as an element of the
common way of life in need of protection. As we have just seen,
considerations of sovereignty are given their full force when they are
considered in the context of the argument from legitimacy. Thus, we
might see the equal protection of normative orders, of the non-political
sovereignty of groups, as a claim of justice, and as something which the
prevailing governing conventions are inadequate to protect.<a
href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> Then considerations of sovereignty
could be subsumed within the argument from legitimacy, for the basic
legitimation demand will only be met by resetting the governing
conventions in such a way that equal claims to the protection of plural
normative orders is met. There is no guarantee that the proposed Voice
will protect or promote Indigenous sovereignty on this understanding. We
might reasonably hope, however, that by giving Indigenous Australians a
greater Voice than they currently have, “this ancient sovereignty can
shine through as a fuller expression of Australia’s Nationhood”.</p>
<p>Whether we adopt these stronger versions of the argument from
legitimacy bolstered by considerations of self-determination and
Indigenous sovereignty or not, a sufficient case can be made for the
proposed Voice on the basis of considerations of political legitimacy.
It has been the aim of this paper to set out such a case.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>The history is complicated. The Australian Constitution
at Federation in 1901 explicitly stated that the Commonwealth did not
have the power make “laws for the peace, order, and good government of
the Commonwealth with respect to” Indigenous Australians. See
<em>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 s 51(xxvi).</em>
Before 1901, the several colonial governments of Australia claimed the
right to exercise such power and authority of Indigenous Australians.
Indigenous Australians were considered British subjects from the moment
of occupation in 1788. This only became the official view of the
colonial governments in the 1830s, however. See <span class="citation"

<li id="fn2"><p>Many think the history of Australian settlement
<em>does</em> call the legitimacy of the Australian Government into
question. See, for instance, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Dodson:2002aa">Dodson (2002)</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="Mansell:2016aa">Mansell (2016)</span> 84. I
focus here primarily on contemporaneous challenges to legitimacy since I
think that these suffice to call the legitimacy of the Australian
government into question. A full solution to the problem of legitimacy
would require addressing the history of settlement. See <span
class="citation" data-cites="Patton:2009aa">Patton (2009)</span> for a
general discussion of the legitimacy of the Australian Government.<a

<li id="fn3"><p>The package includes the Indigenous Voice to Parliament,
a constitutionally enshrined advisory body. (More details on the
proposed Voice are given in the text below.) The package also includes a
proposal for a Makarrata Commission for agreement-making (treaty-making)
and truth-telling about Indigenous History. (Makarrata is a Yolngu word
meaning ‘a coming together after a struggle’). For details on the
proposed package, see <span class="citation"

<li id="fn4"><p>A similar approach is taken by Duncan Ivison, who
writes: “The challenge of constitutional recognition, therefore, is

<li id="fn7"><p>While this aspect of the proposal has generated some
controversy, the potential for the proposed Voice to give advice to
Executive Government as well as Parliament may be required in order for
the proposed Voice to deliver a greater degree of influence over
political decisions. I’d like to thank an anonymous reviewer for the
journal for this point.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Some doubt that the proposed Voice will have such
informal influence over decisions on the basis of the failure of
advisory bodies to have such an influence in the past, and on the basis
of pessimism about the amount of political will that political parties
will have to follow such advice. See, for instance, <span
class="citation" data-cites="Mansell:2016aa">Mansell (2016)</span>
51–53. My aim here isn’t to justify the assumption that the proposed
Voice will have such influence. It is, rather, to justify it on the
assumption that it will. Note that the question of giving Indigenous
Australians more influence over decisions is distinct from the question
of whether this will effectively address the systematic injustice faced
by Indigenous Australians. I address this latter question in the text.<a

Williams spells out his account of non-coercively formed believes in
more detail in Ch. 6 of <span class="citation"
data-cites="Williams:2002aa">Williams (2002)</span>. The appeal to
reasonably and publicly defensible beliefs and values is familiar from
Rawls’s “liberal principle of legitimacy”. See <span class="citation"

of a liberal principle according to which the fundamental principles of
society must be “such that all who are to count as subject to them must
(now) be able from their perspective to see reason to endorse them,
assuming a commitment—which some may in fact not have—to basing
political association on principles that can thus meet with the
reasonable agreement of its citizens” see <span class="citation"
data-cites="Larmore:2020aa">Larmore (2020)</span> Ch. 3. Philip Pettit
has developed a democratic/republican conception of legitimacy which
ties legitimacy to (equality of) democratic control over decisions. See
<span class="citation" data-cites="Pettit:2012aa">Pettit (2012)</span>
12–13. Since the proposed Voice may require that some have greater
democratic control over certain decisions than others, such a conception
may need to be modified in order to accommodate the demands of
Indigenous peoples. See discussion of related issues below.<a
href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn14"><p>I use the expression ‘governing conventions’ here
rather than the narrower ‘constitutional rules’ in order to capture both
formal and informal conventions concerning how government gets done in a
society. Governing conventions are a particular kind of social
convention, namely, those concerning how government gets done in a
society, concerning who holds what offices, who is entitled to exercise
what authority, how that authority is to be exercised, and so on. Social
conventions are a kind of regularity that is widely observed by some
group of agents <span class="citation" data-cites="Lewis:1969aa">(Lewis
1969)</span>. Some conventions will be formal in the sense that they are
formalised in documents like constitutions or in legislation. But a
convention need not be formalised in order to be a convention. Where a
governing convention is vague or ambiguous, the formalisation of a
convention may resolve this vagueness or ambiguity. Governing
conventions can be changed by being formalised in documents like
constitutions or in legislation. I understand the Voice as a proposal to
change the governing conventions of Australian society. This will be
done, in part, by changing the constitution. This will have an immediate
effect on the governing conventions of Australian society. But it is
important to notice that the effects will not only be on the formal
conventions. There will likely also be effects on the informal governing
conventions. For a fuller account of the informal governing conventions
of a society see <span class="citation"

legitimacy has similar consequences: “[T]he political conception of
justice embodied in the institutions and procedures of a given society,
including its constitution, is subject to modification in response to
change in the considered opinions of citizens on matters of justice. To
the extent that citizens’ considered convictions have changed, this may
have implications for constitutional principles and the conditions of
legitimate government” <span class="citation"

influence. On such a model there are, in effect, different
understandings of ‘the people’ for each sphere of authority. The
principle of popular sovereignty applies <em>within</em> each sphere of
authority, but not <em>between</em> each sphere of authority. What
matters is that none have an independent right to greater relative
contributory influence <em>within</em> a sphere of authority. This may
