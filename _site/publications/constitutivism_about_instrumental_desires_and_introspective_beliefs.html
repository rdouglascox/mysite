<p>This essay is about two familiar theses in the philosophy of mind:
constitutivism about instrumental desires, and constitutivism about
introspective beliefs, and the arguments for and against them.
Constitutivism about instrumental desire is the thesis that instrumental
desires are at least partly constituted by the desires and means-end
beliefs which explain them and is a thesis which has been championed
most prominently by Michael Smith. Constitutivism about introspective
belief is the thesis that introspective beliefs are at least partly
constituted by the mental states they are about and is a thesis which
has been championed most prominently by Sydney Shoemaker. Despite their
similarities, the fortunes of these two theses could not be more
opposed: constitutivism about instrumental desire is widely accepted,
and constitutivism about introspective belief is widely rejected. Yet,
the arguments for both theses are roughly analogous. This essay explores
these arguments. I argue that the argument which is widely taken to be
the best argument for constitutivism about instrumental desires—what I
call the argument from necessitation—does not provide the support for
the thesis it is widely taken to provide, and that it fails for much the
same reasons that it fails to provide support for constitutivism about
introspective belief and I argue that the best argument for
constitutivism about instrumental desires—what I will call the argument
from cognitive dynamics—is also a good argument, if not an equally good
argument, for constitutivism about introspective belief (at least when
the thesis is suitably qualified).</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This essay is about two familiar theses in the philosophy of mind:
<em>constitutivism about instrumental desires</em>, and
<em>constitutivism about introspective beliefs</em>, and the arguments
for and against them. Constitutivism about instrumental desire is the
thesis that instrumental desires are at least partly constituted by the
desires and means-end beliefs which explain them and is a thesis which
has been championed most prominently by Michael Smith <span
class="citation" data-cites="smith2004">(Smith 2004)</span>.
Constitutivism about introspective belief is the thesis that
introspective beliefs are at least partly constituted by the mental
states they are about and is a thesis which has been championed most
prominently by Sydney Shoemaker <span class="citation"
data-cites="shoemaker1996 shoemaker2012">(Shoemaker 1996, 2012)</span>.
Despite their similarities, the fortunes of these two theses could not
be more opposed: constitutivism about instrumental desire is widely
accepted, and constitutivism about introspective belief is widely
rejected. Yet, the arguments for both theses are roughly analogous. So
if one thesis is to be accepted while the other is rejected there must
be good reasons for rejecting the arguments for one thesis but not the
other.</p>
<p>In this essay, I argue that the <em>best</em> argument for
constitutivism about instrumental desires—what I will call the
<em>argument from cognitive dynamics</em>—is also a <em>good</em>
argument, if not an <em>equally good</em> argument, for constitutivism
about introspective belief (at least when the thesis is suitably
qualified). So, at least with respect to this argument, there are no
good reasons for accepting one thesis while rejecting the other. At the
same time, however, I argue that the argument which is widely taken to
be the best argument for constitutivism about instrumental desires—what
I will call the <em>argument from necessitation</em>—does not provide
the support for the thesis it is widely taken to provide, and that it
fails for much the same reasons that it fails to provide support for
constitutivism about introspective belief. So, with respect to this
argument, there are no good reasons for accepting one thesis while
rejecting the other, because this argument does not give us good reasons
for accepting either thesis.</p>
<p>These conclusions suggest that the fortunes of constitutivism about
instrumental desire and constitutivism about introspective belief are
more closely tied together than is often appreciated. Indeed, I hope to
bring to bear on the topic of instrumental desire an important lesson
which has been learnt in the philosophy of introspection. For
philosophers of introspection have shown that the argument from
necessitation for introspective belief is unsuccessful. This partly
explains why constitutivism about introspective belief is not widely
accepted in the way constitutivism about instrumental desire is. Yet an
analogous lesson for the argument from necessitation for constitutivism
about instrumental desire has not yet been absorbed by those working on
the philosophy of instrumental desire. There is a certain irony here,
since Shoemaker explicitly draws analogies with the case of instrumental
desire—particularly the role played by means-end beliefs and
non-instrumental desires in rationalising and explaining further
desires—in developing his arguments for constitutivism about
introspective belief <span class="citation"
data-cites="shoemaker1996">(Shoemaker 1996)</span>. Rejecting this
argument for constitutivism about instrumental desire puts this thesis
on a less firm footing, and brings its fortunes more closely into line
with those of constitutivism about instrumental desire. As I will argue,
the fortunes of both theses rest on the prospects of the argument from
cognitive dynamics. I hope to show that, even if the argument from
cognitive dynamics is taken to offer adequate support for constitutivism
about instrumental desire while ultimately not offering adequate support
for constitutivism about introspective belief, the fortunes of these two
theses are tied closer together than is often appreciated.</p>
<p>The essay is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses some
preliminary issues concerning how constitutivism about instrumental
desire and constitutivism about introspective belief are to be
understood. Section 3 considers the argument from necessitation for
constitutivism about instrumental desire and the argument from
necessitation for constitutivism about introspective belief
respectively. I argue that both arguments fail. Section 4 considers the
argument from cognitive dynamics for constitutivism about instrumental
desire and the argument from cognitive dynamics for constitutivism about
introspective belief respectively. I argue that the arguments provide
equally good reasons for accepting both theses.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="locating-the-topic"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Locating the Topic</h1>
<p>At the outset, we are going to need a way of understanding
instrumental desires and introspective beliefs which does not prejudice
the case either for or against the respective constitutivist theses. It
might be thought, after all, that there isn’t much to say about
constitutivism about instrumental desire, since instrumental desires
just are, by definition, according to some, those desires which are at
least partly constituted by the desires and means-end beliefs which
explain them. While the term ‘instrumental desire’ is sometimes used
this way, there is a more neutral way of understanding instrumental
desires which does not prejudice the issue in this way. We can simply
say that instrumental desires just are, by definition, those desires
which are <em>rationally explained</em> by other desires and means-end
beliefs, where we leave open the question of whether the former is
partly constituted by the latter. This neutral understanding of
instrumental desire is widespread in the literature <span
class="citation"
data-cites="marks1986 davis1986 shroeder2004 mcdaniel2008 arpaly_and_schroeder2014">(Marks
1986, 9; Davis 1986, 69; Schroeder 2004, 5; McDaniel and Bradley 2008,
286; Schroeder and Arpaly 2014, 6)</span>. It is arguably this
understanding which Hume has in mind when he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask a man <em>why he uses exercise</em>; he will answer <em>because
he desires to keep his health</em>. If you then enquire, <em>why he
desires to keep his health</em>, he will readily reply, <em>because his
sickness is painful</em>. If you push your enquiries farther, and desire
a reason <em>why he hates pain</em>, it is impossible he can ever give
any. This is an ultimate end, and is never referred to any other
object.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, Hume distinguishes between what we would call the
instrumental desire to exercise, rationally explained by a desire to
keep one’s health, and the non-instrumental desire to avoid pain, not
explained by any further desire. When Michael Smith writes “I will call
the desires which are explained by [non-instrumental] desires and
means-end beliefs ‘instrumental’ desires” <span class="citation"
data-cites="smith2004">(Smith 2004, 95)</span> he is clearly stating
that he means to use ‘instrumental desires’ in this neutral way.<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>On this way of understanding instrumental desires, it is clearly a
substantive question whether instrumental desires are partly constituted
by means-end beliefs and other desires. Of course, many theorists accept
this substantive thesis about instrumental desires. Here is Smith’s
assertion of his commitment to constitutivism about instrumental
desire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instrumental desires are not distinct from the non-instrumental
desires and means-end beliefs that explain them, but are rather just the
complex state of having such non-instrumental desires and means-end
beliefs standing in a suitable relation <span class="citation"
data-cites="smith2004">(Smith 2004, 96)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Smith, then, instrumental desires are (at least partly,
if not wholly) constituted by non-instrumental desires and means-end
beliefs standing in suitable relations. As he puts it: “Instrumental
desires are thus better thought of as being nothing over and above the
non-instrumental desires and means-end beliefs that explain them” <span
class="citation" data-cites="smith2004">(Smith 2004, 96)</span>.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Here Smith appears to commit himself
to a strong form of constitutivism about instrumental desire, one which
holds that instrumental desires are “nothing over and above” or are
<em>wholly constituted</em> by the non-instrumental desires and
means-end beliefs that explain them standing in a suitable relation.
Constitutivism about instrumental desire, so understood, is a widely
accepted thesis in the philosophy of mind. However, as we have just
seen, it is a substantive thesis about instrumental desires, and we will
be concerned with the arguments for it in the next two sections.</p>
<p>Introspective beliefs raise their own unique problems for
understanding. While there is no temptation in the case of introspective
beliefs to hold that they are, by definition, beliefs which are partly
constituted by the mental states they are about, it is nonetheless
difficult to say what an introspective belief is. It is not enough to
say that an introspective belief is just a belief about one’s own mental
states. For, it is relatively uncontroversial that at least some of our
beliefs about our own mental states are arrived at on the basis of
inference. And these beliefs are very plausibly thought of as being
constitutively distinct from the mental states they are about. They are
no more constituted by the mental states they are about than our beliefs
about the mental states of others are constituted by the mental states
they are about. Rather, introspective beliefs must be understood as
beliefs about our own mental states which are arrived at by some special
means and are not based on evidence or observation in the way that our
beliefs about the mental states of others are.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
While it is a matter of controversy how introspective beliefs are to be
understood, I will assume that some such distinction can be drawn
between beliefs about our own mental states and that only some of these
beliefs will count as introspective beliefs. Constitutivism about
introspective beliefs holds that <em>these</em> beliefs are at least
partly constituted by the mental states they are about. Here is
Shoemaker’s assertion of his commitment to constitutivism about
introspective belief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I am inclined to say is that second-order belief, and the
knowledge it typically embodies, is supervenient on first order beliefs
and desires—or rather, it is supervenient on these plus a certain degree
of rationality, intelligence, and conceptual capacity. By this I mean
that one has the former <em>in</em> having the latter—that having the
former is nothing over and above having the latter. <span
class="citation" data-cites="shoemaker1996">(Shoemaker 1996,
34)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Shoemaker, then, introspective beliefs are at least
partly (if not wholly) constituted by the mental states they are about
together with “a certain degree of rationality, intelligence, and
conceptual capacity”—having the former is “nothing over and above”
having the latter. This passage anticipates the argument to be examined
in the next section, as Shoemaker moves here from a claim about
supervenience or necessitation to a claim about constitution. So we have
seen that constitutivism about introspective belief is a substantive
thesis about introspective belief. It will be the aim of the next
sections of the essay to evaluate such arguments for both forms of
constitutivism.</p>
<p>Before turning to those arguments a final qualification is in order.
In the passage from Shoemaker just quoted, Shoemaker is concerned with a
kind of constitutivism about introspective beliefs which concerns
introspective beliefs about <em>attitudes</em> in particular. For the
most part, in what follows, I will be concerned with forms of
constitutivism about introspective belief which are restricted in this
way, holding that introspective beliefs about our <em>attitudes</em> are
partly constituted by the attitudes they are about. Introspective
beliefs about phenomenally conscious states raise further issues that I
will not be able to address here, and while constitutivism about these
introspective beliefs may be defensible, different arguments may be
required.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> There is also an interesting
question about how constitutivism might be extended to states which are
plausibly thought of as having both cognitive and non-cognitive
components, like emotions. While I think that constitutivism can be
defended for a wide range of mental states, I will largely set aside
such an exploration here, and will focus on the particular case of
introspective beliefs about our own attitudes. I will also set aside the
difficult question of whether we can or should expect a uniform account
of introspection and introspective beliefs which applies to all mental
states.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Finally, related to these questions
is the question of which theories of introspection—theories of the means
by which we arrive at introspective beliefs—are compatible with
constitutivism about introspective beliefs and those which are not. Some
theories of introspection have implications for the relation between
introspective beliefs and the mental states they are about. The
self-scanning theory of David Armstrong has the implication that
introspective beliefs are constitutively distinct from the states they
are about since the former are caused by the latter <span
class="citation" data-cites="Armstrong1968-AMTOTM">(Armstrong
1968)</span>. Other theories are neutral about the relation and while
they may provide causal explanations of the means by which we arrive at
introspective beliefs—by means of answering deliberative questions <span
class="citation" data-cites="moran2001">(Moran 2001)</span>, or by means
of an ascent-routine <span class="citation"
data-cites="gordon1986">(Gordon 1986)</span>—they remain compatible with
the possibility that introspective beliefs are partly constituted by the
attitudes they are about. I will also set aside this question, as the
arguments we will consider for constitutivism about introspective belief
do not presuppose any particular theory of introspection.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="the-arguments-from-necessitation"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> The Arguments from
Necessitation</h1>
<p>In this section I will formulate and evaluate the argument from
necessitation for constitutivism about instrumental desire and the
argument from necessitation for constitutivism about introspective
belief. The arguments belong to a family of arguments, arguments from
necessitation or supervenience, which are familiar enough across many
areas of philosophy. The crucial step in such arguments is a move from a
claim about metaphysical necessitation or supervenience, to a claim
about constitution. I will first formulate and motivate each argument
and then turn to evaluation.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1"
id="for-constitutivism-about-instrumental-desire"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> For Constitutivism About
Instrumental Desire</h2>
<p>For simplicity, we can formulate and motivate the argument from
necessitation for constitutivism about instrumental desire by focussing
on an arbitrary example which we can take to reveal something general
about instrumental desires. Suppose, then that Jane desires to exercise
because she desires to keep her health, and believes that exercising is
a means to keeping her health. It follows from our understanding of
instrumental desires, and the assumption that this is the ‘because’ of
rational explanation, that Jane instrumentally desires to exercise. Why
think that Jane’s desiring to exercise is at least partly constituted by
her desiring to keep her health and her believing that exercising is a
means to keeping her health? The argument from necessitation proceeds in
two steps.</p>
<p>The first step establishes that the relation between Jane’s desiring
to keep her health, her believing that exercising is a means to keeping
her health, <em>her being fully rational</em>, and her desiring to
exercise is not a merely contingent relation, but is, in some sense
necessary. We can bring this out by reflecting on a claim about
necessity like the following:</p>
<table style="width:97%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 12%" />
<col style="width: 84%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>N1</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Necessarily, if Jane desires to keep her
health, believes that exercising is a means to keeping her health, and
is fully rational, then she desires to exercise.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I will have more to say about the relevant understanding of ‘is fully
rational’ in this claim below, and will connect this to Smith’s claims
about means-end beliefs and non-instrumental desires standing in
suitable relations. But for now, we can simply observe that on a natural
understanding of ‘is fully rational’ such a claim is intuitively
plausible. To bring this out we might notice that while it is certainly
possible for Jane to desire to keep her health, to believe that
exercising is a means to keeping her health, while not desiring to
exercise to any degree—after all, she might be less than fully
rational—it is not possible for her to desire to keep her health, to
believe that exercising is a means to keeping her health, and not desire
to exercise to any degree <em>if she is fully rational</em>.</p>
<p>The second step establishes the best explanation of the necessary
connection is that Jane’s desiring to exercise is at least partly, if
not wholly, constituted by her desiring to keep her health, her
believing that exercising is a means to keeping her health, and her
being fully rational. While it might be tempting to move directly from
the claim about necessitation to this conclusion, it is important to see
that there are alternative explanations of the necessary connection
which need to be considered. The explanations of the necessary
connection we need to consider in this case are these:</p>
<table style="width:97%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 12%" />
<col style="width: 84%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>H1</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Jane’s desiring to exercise is wholly
constituted by her desiring to keep her health, her believing that
exercising is a means to keeping her health, and her being fully
rational.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>H2</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Jane’s desiring to keep her health, her
believing that exercising is a means to keeping her health, and her
being fully rational is partly constituted by her desiring to
exercise.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>H3</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">There is something that Jane’s desiring to
exercise is wholly constituted by and which Jane’s desiring to keep her
health, her believing that exercising is a means to keeping her health
and her being fully rational is partly constituted by.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These explanations correspond to the familiar options for explaining
necessary connections of this form. If there is a necessary connection
between something’s being an F and its being both a G and an H, then we
might explain this necessary connection by holding that its being an F
is wholly constituted by its being a G and an H, or by holding that its
being a G and an H is partly constituted by its being an F, or by
holding that there is something else, such that its being a G and an H
is partly constituted by and its being an F is wholly constituted
by.</p>
<p>Of these explanations, <strong>H1</strong> certainly looks to be the
best. There is no candidate for the kind of third-factor required by
<strong>H3</strong>, and, at least initially, it is hard to see why
Jane’s desiring to keep her health, her believing that exercising is a
means to keeping her health, and her being fully rational, would be
partly constituted by her desiring to exercise: none of these conditions
seem to be independently partly constituted by her desiring to exercise,
and it is hard to see how, jointly, they could be partly constituted by
her desiring to exercise. So we may tentatively conclude that
<strong>H1</strong> provides the best explanation of the necessary
connection.</p>
<p>These two steps, then, provide motivation for the two premises of the
argument from necessitation for constitutivism about instrumental
desire. We can think of the argument as proceeding as follows:</p>

<p>Since the example we have focused on here was entirely arbitrary, the
same reasoning can be followed in arguing for constitutivism about
instrumental desire as a general thesis. At least initially, then, the
argument from necessitation provides a good case for constitutivism
about instrumental desire. I will now explicate an analogous argument
for constitutivism about introspective belief before turning to
objections.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2"
id="for-constitutivism-about-introspective-belief"><span
class="header-section-number">3.2</span> For Constitutivism About
Introspective Belief</h2>
<p>For simplicity, we can formulate and motivate the argument from
necessitation for constitutivism about introspective belief by focusing
on an arbitrary example which we can take to reveal something general
about introspective beliefs. Suppose that Jane introspectively believes
that she believes it is about to rain. Why think that Jane’s believing
that she believes it is about to rain is not constitutively distinct
from her believing that it is about to rain? The argument proceeds in
two steps.</p>
<p>The first step establishes that the relation between Jane’s believing
that she believes that it is about to rain and her believing that it is
about to rain, her having some interest in the question of whether she
believes that it is about to rain, and her being fully rational, is not
a merely contingent relation, but is, in some sense, necessary. We can
bring this out by reflecting on a claim about necessity like the
following:</p>
<table style="width:97%;">
<colgroup>

<td style="text-align: left;">Necessarily, if Jane believes that it is
about to rain, understands and has some interest in the question of
whether she believes that it is about to rain, and is fully rational,
then she believes that she believes that it is about to rain.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A few clarifications are in order here. Recall Shoemaker’s claim that
introspective beliefs are supervenient on “a certain degree of
rationality, intelligence, and conceptual capacity”. This suggests a
claim like the following: necessarily, if Jane believes that it is about
to rain, has a certain degree of rationality, intelligence, and
conceptual capacity, she believes that it is about to rain. Shoemaker
adds these claims about intelligence and conceptual capacity here in
order to avoid problems stemming from small children and animals who may
have the relevant attitudes, have a certain degree of rationality, and
yet not even be able to understand the question of whether they have the
attitudes in question. I have captured this element of Shoemaker’s view
with the claim about understanding in <strong>N2</strong>. However, I
have added the further claim that Jane must <em>have some interest in
the question of whether she believes that it is about to rain</em>.
Arguably, Shoemaker’s conditions are too weak. It seems to be possible
for Jane to believe that it is about to rain, for her to understand the
question of whether she believes that it is about to rain, for her to be
fully rational, and yet for her not to believe that she believes that it
is about to rain <em>if she has no interest in the question of whether
she believes that it is about to rain</em>.<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
Quite generally, it seems that we will not believe that we have some
attitude or another when we have no interest in the question of whether
we have that attitude. With these clarifications in order, we can see
that this claim is intuitively plausible on a natural understanding of
‘is fully rational’. To bring this out we might notice that while it is
certainly possible for Jane to believe that it is about to rain, to have
some interest in the question of whether she believes that it is about
to rain, while not believing that she believes that it is about to
rain—after all, she might be less than fully rational—it is not possible
for her to believe that it is about to rain, to have some interest in
the question of whether she believes that it is about to rain, and to
not believe that she believes that it is about to rain <em>if she is
fully rational.</em></p>
<p>The second step establishes that the best explanation of this
necessary connection is that Jane’s believing that she believes that it
is about to rain is at least partly, if not wholly, constituted by her
believing that it is about to rain, her having some interest in the
question of whether she believes that it is about to rain, and her being
fully rational. Again, we must consider the alternative explanations.
The explanations of the necessary connections we need to consider in
this case are these:</p>

<p>Since the example we have focused on here was entirely arbitrary, the
same reasoning can be followed in arguing for constitutivism about
introspective belief as a general thesis. At least initially, then, the
argument from necessitation provides a good case for constitutivism
about introspective belief.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="evaluating-the-arguments"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Evaluating the Arguments</h2>
<p>We can now turn to evaluation of the arguments from necessitation.
Whether the arguments are successful turns crucially on how the notion
of rationality is understood. So far I have presented the arguments
without comment on how rationality is to be understood. I will now argue
that there are two understandings of ‘being fully rational’ which are
relevant to the arguments from necessitation: an evaluative sense and a
dispositional sense. When the arguments are understood in terms of the
former, their first premises are true, but their second premises are
false. When the arguments are understood in terms of the latter, their
first premises are false. The arguments get whatever force they have
from equivocating on these two understandings of ‘being fully rational’.
This objection to the arguments from necessitation is due, in its
essentials, to Amy Kind, who makes the objection in connection with the
argument from necessitation for constitutivism about introspective
belief <span class="citation" data-cites="kind2003">(Kind
2003)</span>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> While the objection has been
generally appreciated in the philosophical literature on introspection
<span class="citation" data-cites="gertlerbook2011">(Gertler

literature on instrumental desires.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>It is natural to think about the arguments above on an evaluative
understanding of ‘being fully rational’. On this understanding, someone
is fully rational if and only if they are not in violation of the
principles of rationality, that is, if and only if they fully conform to
the principles of rationality. On this understanding, someone is less
than fully rational if they do not fully conform to the principles of
rationality. It is very plausible that there is a principle of
rationality which requires you to desire the means if you desire some
end and believe that the means are a means to that end. Similarly, it is
very plausible that there is a principle of rationality which requires
you to believe that you have some attitude if you have that attitude and
you understand and have some interest in the question of whether you
have it. This can be brought out by reflecting on the necessitation
claims with this understanding of ‘being fully rational’ made fully
explicit:</p>

<p>Since it is arguably this understanding of ‘being fully rational’
which we evaluated the original necessitation claims with, it is not
surprising that they both appear to be plausible when this understanding
is made fully explicit.</p>
<p>The problem arises for the arguments from necessitation when we turn
to the evaluation of their second premises on this understanding. To see
the problem in the case of instrumental desire, notice that if Jane
desires to keep her health and believes that exercising is a means to
keeping her health, then, in order to fully conform to the principles of
rationality, she must desire to exercise. But then, given that she
desires to keep her health and believes that exercising is a means to
keeping her health, <em>if</em> she fully conforms to the principles of
rationality, this must be at least partly because she desires to
exercise. So, her fully conforming to the principles of rationality is
partly constituted by her desiring to exercise. And if her fully
conforming to the principles of rationality is partly constituted by her
desiring to exercise, her desiring to exercise cannot be even partly
constituted by her conforming to the principles of rationality. So, on
this understanding of ‘being fully rational’ <strong>H1</strong> is not
the best explanation of the necessary connection and the argument from
necessitation fails.</p>
<p>To see the problem in the case of introspective belief, notice that
if Jane believes that it is about to rain, and understands and has some
interest in the question of whether she believes that it is about to

she must believe that she believes that it is about to rain. But then,
given that she believes that it is about to rain, and understands and
has some interest in the question of whether she believes that it is
about to rain, <em>if</em> she fully conforms to the principles of
rationality, this must be at least partly because she desires to
exercise. So, her fully conforming to the principles of rationality is
partly constituted by her believing that she believes that it is about
to rain. And if her fully conforming to the principles of rationality is
partly constituted by her believing that she believes that it is about
to rain, her believing that she believes that it is about to rain cannot
be even partly constituted by her fully conforming to the principles of
rationality. So on this understanding <strong>H1</strong> is not the
best explanation of the necessary connection and the argument from
necessitation fails.</p>
<p>An analogy might help to drive home the crucial point here. Suppose
that you are legally required to pay your taxes before the end of the
financial year every financial year. Then, you fully conform to the law
only if you pay your taxes before the end of the financial year every
year. Now, if it is the end of the financial year, then <em>if</em> you
fully conform to the law, this must be at least partly because you have
paid your taxes. So, your fully conforming to the law is partly
constituted by your paying your taxes. And if your fully conforming to
the law is partly constituted by your paying your taxes, then your
paying your taxes cannot be, even partly, constituted by your fully
conforming to the law. As this analogy demonstrates, while conforming to
certain norms may, along with other conditions, necessitate certain
further conditions, it is your conforming to the norms which is partly
constituted by those further conditions, and not vice versa. It is not
surprising then that on the evaluative understanding of ‘being fully
rational’ the second premises of the arguments from necessitation are
false.</p>
<p>At this stage a proponent of the arguments from necessitation may
argue that this is not the understanding of ‘being fully rational’ they
had in mind. They may instead appeal to a dispositional understanding of
‘being fully rational’. On this understanding, being fully rational is
being disposed to conform to the principles of rationality (perhaps
along with there being no barrier to one’s manifesting this
disposition). Someone who was fully disposed to conform to the
principles of rationality, where there is no barrier to their
manifesting this disposition, would very plausibly <em>come to
desire</em> to exercise if they desired to keep their health and
believed that exercising was a means to keeping their health. Someone
who was fully disposed to conform to the principles of rationality,
where there was no barrier to their manifesting this disposition, would
very plausibly <em>come to believe</em> that they believed that it was
about to rain if they believed that it was about to rain and understood
and had some interest in the question of whether they believed that it
was about to rain. The trouble with this understanding is that the first
premises of the arguments from necessitation seem to be false if they
are understood in terms of it. To see the trouble, we can reflect on the
necessitation claims with this understanding of ‘being fully rational’
made fully explicit:</p>
<table style="width:97%;">

that it is about to rain.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The problem here is that even when all barriers to the manifestation
of a disposition are removed, there is no metaphysically necessary
connection between having the disposition, the triggering conditions for
the disposition obtaining, and the disposition manifesting. At best, the
relation between having a disposition, the triggering conditions for
that disposition obtaining, and the manifestation of the disposition, is
one of <em>nomological necessity</em>. On this understanding of ‘being
fully rational’ the first premises of the arguments from necessitation
are false, and there is no necessary connection between being certain
psychological conditions, being fully rational, and being in some
further psychological condition.</p>
<p>It might be thought at this point that we might add some further
condition to the antecedents of the conditionals above to avoid this
problem. My response to this suggestion, however, is that there is
nothing that can be added that will not either (i) fall prey to
considerations like those just given against the current proposal or
(ii) fall prey to considerations like those given against the evaluative
understanding of ‘being fully rational’. Suppose someone suggests that
we need only add to the antecedents of the conditionals that the
dispositions be manifested. Then we would have:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>But this suggestion faces a problem analogous to that faced by the
view which understands ‘being fully rational’ in the evaluative sense.
Given that Jane desires to keep her health, believes that exercising is
a means to keeping her health, and is disposed to conform to the
principles of rationality, <em>if</em> she manifests her disposition,
this must be in part because she desires to exercise. To manifest this
disposition is, in part, to come to desire to exercise. So, her
manifesting this disposition is partly constituted by her desiring to
exercise. And if her manifesting this disposition is partly constituted
by her desiring to exercise, her desiring to exercise cannot be even
partly constituted by her manifesting this disposition (and so cannot be
wholly constituted by her desiring to keep her health, believing that
exercising is a means to keeping her health, being disposed to conform
to the principles of rationality, and manifesting this disposition). I
suspect that Smith’s appeal to the idea that a means-end belief and a
non-instrumental desire must stand ‘in a suitable relation’ in his
statement of constitutivism about instrumental desire is an attempt to
straddle the gap here between the triggering conditions of a disposition
obtaining and the disposition manifesting. As we have just seen,
however, if we understand the claim in terms of the triggering
conditions being met—the means-end belief and the non-instrumental
desire are appropriately related just when they trigger the relevant
disposition—then Smith’s position falls prey to considerations like
those given against the dispositional understanding, and if we
understand it in terms of the disposition manifesting—the means-end
belief and the non-instrumental desire are appropriately related just
when the relevant disposition manifests—then it falls prey to the
considerations just given.</p>
<p>As initially compelling as the arguments from necessitation may seem,
they are ultimately unsuccessful. As I said earlier, this is old news in
the literature on introspective belief. There, it is widely conceded
that Sydney Shoemaker may be right about the necessitation claim, at
least if it is understood on the evaluative sense of ‘rational’, but it
is held that nothing follows from this vis a vis the constitutive theory
of introspective belief. The problem is that Shoemaker moves too quickly
from the necessitation claim to the constitution claim. To see this,
consider the passage quoted earlier from Shoemaker. There Shoemaker
moves from a supervenience claim in the first sentence to the
constitution claim in the second. Indeed, he says that he means the same
thing by both claims. But, at best, he has only argued for the
metaphysical necessitation or supervenience claim, and the constitution
claim does not immediately follow, as we have seen.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>It is doubtful that Shoemaker had the evaluative sense of ‘rational’
in mind, however. In one of the only places where Shoemaker gives us any
clues about the sense of rationality he has in mind, he writes: “The
fact that the person is rational might be compared to the fact that the
powder in the bomb was dry” <span class="citation"
data-cites="shoemaker1996">(Shoemaker 1996, 32)</span>. This certainly
suggests that Shoemaker had the dispositional sense in mind. And, as we
have seen, it is plausible that <em>if</em> the necessitation claim were
true on the dispositional sense of ‘rational’, then the constitution
claim would follow. It is widely agreed, however, that Shoemaker’s
arguments for the necessitation claim do not establish the necessitation
claim. Those who think that the necessitation claim is true, think that
it is true on the evaluative sense of ‘rational’, but for independent
reasons.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> I suspect that no argument could
establish the necessitation claim on the dispositional sense of
‘rational’, so I am sceptical about the prospects of the argument from
necessitation. Nonetheless, as I will now argue, there is a better
argument for constitutivism about introspective belief available, one
which is implicit in Shoemaker’s work but which gets overshadowed by the
argument from necessitation.</p>

<p>These are claims about the cognitive dynamics of particular desires.
They are the cognitive dynamics of someone who is rational, that is,
someone who is disposed to conform to the principles of rationality.
These cognitive dynamics are partly constitutive of what it is to be
disposed to conform to the principles of rationality. It is because we
observe these cognitive dynamics that we believe that we are rational in
this sense.</p>
<p>How could a cognitive system exhibit these dynamics? To see how,
let’s assume a broadly functionalist picture of beliefs and desires. On
this picture, for X to believe that P is for X to be in some state or
other which plays the believing-that-P-role, and for X to desire to
<span class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span> is for X to be in some state
or other which plays the desiring-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role. We could then re-describe
the cognitive dynamics above in terms of ceasing to be in a state which
plays the desiring-to-<span class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role
under certain conditions, and coming to be in a state which plays the
desiring-to-<span class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role under
certain conditions. But now two importantly different hypotheses arise
concerning the relations between these states.</p>
<p>According to one hypothesis, call it the <em>causal hypothesis</em>,
the dynamics are explained by the fact that when someone comes to be in
a state which plays the desiring-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role, and someone comes to be in a
state which plays the believing-that-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-is-a-means-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-ing-role, their coming to be in
these states jointly <em>causes</em> them—by means of their manifesting
a rational disposition—to come to be in a state which plays the
desiring-to-<span class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> role. Similarly,
someone’s ceasing to be in a state which plays the believing-that-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-is-a-means-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-ing-role or ceasing to be in a
state which plays the desiring-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span> role will cause them to cease
being in a state which plays the desiring-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-role. Rational dispositions can
then be thought of as ordinary causal dispositions, where the triggering
conditions are thought of as causes of the manifestations. On this
hypothesis the cognitive dynamics are explained by various causal
transactions between constitutively distinct states or events involving
constitutively distinct states (they must be constitutively distinct in
order to stand in causal relations).</p>
<p>According to another hypothesis, call it the <em>constitutive
hypothesis</em>, the dynamics are explained by the fact that when
someone comes to be in a state which plays the desiring-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role and someone comes to be in a
state which plays the believing-that-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-is-a-means-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-ing-role, their coming to be in
these states constitutes—by means of their manifesting a rational
disposition—their coming to be in a state which plays the
desiring-to-<span class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-role. It does so
because the former states together <em>constitute</em> a state which
plays the desiring-to-<span class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role.
Similarly, someone’s ceasing to be in a state which plays the
believing-that-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-is-a-means-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-ing-role or ceasing to be in a
state which plays the desiring-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role just is their ceasing to be
in a state which plays the desiring to <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> role. Rational dispositions, on
this hypothesis, are not ordinary causal dispositions. They are what we
might call constitutive dispositions, since the triggering conditions
bear a constitutive relation to the manifestations. On this hypothesis
the cognitive dynamics are explained in terms of states which play
particular roles jointly constituting states which play other roles. The
relevant thing about the constitutive hypothesis is that, if it is true,
then instrumental desires are not distinct from the desires and
means-end beliefs which explain them. This is because instrumental
desires are partly constituted by states which partly constitute the
corresponding desires and means-end beliefs which explain them. So if
there is an argument for the constitutive hypothesis, there is an
argument for constitutivism about instrumental desire.</p>
<p>Each of these hypotheses is clearly an empirical hypothesis. If
cognitive science were so advanced that we could determine which states
play which roles, then, in principle we could settle the question of
whether the states are constitutively distinct and causally related or
constitutively non-distinct and constitutively rather than causally
related. But we are far from being able to answer the question this way.
The best we have, and the best we may ever have, is indirect evidence
for one hypothesis over the other based on arguments to the best
explanation of the observed cognitive dynamics. Let’s consider the
evidence for and against, then.</p>
<p>Perhaps the weakest consideration in favour of the constitutive
hypothesis, but a consideration nonetheless, comes from the relative
cognitive efficiency of having the states which play the role of certain
desires being constituted by the states which play the roles of other
desires and means-end beliefs, rather than having the former be distinct
from and caused by the latter. A cognitive system requires far fewer
distinct states and fewer dependencies between them in order to have a
wide range of instrumental desires on the constitutive hypothesis. To
put the point in slogan form: <em>the constitutive hypothesis is
cognitively more efficient than the causal hypothesis.</em></p>
<p>A stronger consideration in favour of the constitutive hypothesis
comes from the observation that the causal-roles which are definitive of
desires and means-end beliefs, along with the principles of rationality,
predict that by merely having those desires and means-end beliefs, and
being rational, the agent will be disposed to act <em>as if</em> she
desired the means. If desiring the means were a matter of coming to be
in a distinct state which plays the role of desiring the means, as the
causal-hypothesis holds, then the disposition to act as if one desired
the means would be over-determined. There’s nothing by way of the
agent’s dispositions to act that being in this state would contribute
which is not already contributed by their being in these other states
and their being rational. The state is motivationally redundant.<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> So, to put the point in slogan
form: <em>the constitutive hypothesis avoids the prediction that
instrumental desires are motivationally redundant.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest consideration in favour of the constitutive
hypothesis, the one that I am willing to put the most weight on, begins
with an observation about the strength of the dependence of instrumental
desires on means-end beliefs and other desires. As we saw earlier, one
claim about the cognitive dynamics of instrumental desires is that if
someone merely instrumentally desires to <span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span> and they cease desiring to <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> or cease believing that <span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-ing is a means to <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing, then they will cease desiring
to <span class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>. While this claim is
compatible with both the constitutive and causal hypotheses, the
constitutive hypothesis has a far better explanation of it. Indeed, the
explanation comes for free on the constitutive hypothesis, since it is
no surprise that when one ceases to be in either of the states which
jointly constitutes the state which plays the desiring-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role that one will cease desiring
to <span class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>. The causal hypothesis
requires the auxiliary hypothesis here that when the state which plays
the desiring-to-<span class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role is
caused and explained by the states which play the other roles, it will
remain causally dependent on those states. Of course, it is possible
that, simply as a matter of fact, such a state will remain causally
dependent on these other states. But this claim has to be added as an
auxiliary hypothesis to the causal hypothesis, thus making the
hypothesis more complicated than the constitutive hypothesis. And,
moreover, there is every reason to think that this causal dependence
would sometimes break down, giving rise to stray instrumental desires,
desires which are no longer dependent on the means-end beliefs and
desires which caused them in the first place. But if this phenomenon
exists in our psychology, it remains unobserved. The constitutive
hypothesis correctly predicts that there will be no stray instrumental
desires. To sum up the point of this paragraph in slogan form:
<em>instrumental desires are deeply dependent on other mental states for
their existence and the constitutive hypothesis best explains
this</em>.</p>
<p>It is basically this consideration which motivates the argument in
the following passage from Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a striking fact that instrumental desires disappear immediately
an agent loses either the relevant non-instrumental desire or means-end
belief …. Yet there is no reason why this should be so if an
instrumental desire were merely a desire that has a non-instrumental
desire and a means-end belief somewhere in its causal history. Why
should a desire disappear when (say) the desire that caused it, way back
when, disappears? Instrumental desires are thus better thought of as
being nothing over an above the non-instrumental desires and means-end
beliefs that explain them. <span class="citation"
data-cites="smith2004">(Smith 2004, 96)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith begins here with the observation that instrumental desires are
deeply dependent on the desires and means-end beliefs which explain
them. He then argues against the causal hypothesis and for the
constitutive hypothesis on the basis of the fact that the latter
provides a better explanation of the observation than the former. Of
course, Smith’s argument against the causal hypothesis is too fast. An
instrumental desire could remain causally dependent on another desire
and a means-end belief in the way that a light’s being on remains
causally dependent on the light switch’s being turned on. It could be
that the relation between an instrumental desire and the desire and
means-end belief which explains it is like this. But the constitutive
hypothesis nonetheless provides a better explanation of the deep
dependence between an instrumental desire and the desire and means-end
belief which explains it.</p>
<p>The best argument, then, for constitutivism about instrumental desire
is the argument from cognitive dynamics. Unlike the argument from
necessitation for constitutivism about instrumental desire, which would
decisively establish constitutivism about instrumental desire if it were
cogent, the argument from cognitive dynamics makes constitutivism about
instrumental desire the conclusion of an ordinary argument to the best
explanation. But it isn’t really surprising that this should be so,
since constitutivism about instrumental desire is a contingent
hypothesis about instrumental desires.</p>

Introspective Belief</h2>
<p>If the argument from cognitive dynamics for constitutivism about
instrumental desire provides good support for constitutivism about
instrumental desire, then perhaps an analogous argument from cognitive
dynamics could provide good support for constitutivism about
introspective belief. In this section I argue that it does.</p>
<p>The argument from cognitive dynamics for constitutivism about
introspective belief begins from an observation about the cognitive
dynamics of introspective beliefs. The observation is that introspective
beliefs systematically come and go with the mental states—or in the case
under consideration, the attitudes—that they are about.</p>

<p>These are claims about the cognitive dynamics of particular beliefs.
They are the cognitive dynamics of someone who is rational, that is,
someone who is disposed to conform to the principles of rationality.
These cognitive dynamics are partly constitutive of what it is to be
disposed to conform to the principles of rationality. It is because we
observe these cognitive dynamics that we believe that we are rational in
this sense.</p>
<p>Now, let me be upfront here about an important disanalogy with the
observation about the cognitive dynamics of instrumental desires. The
observation just given is likely to strike many as highly controversial.
Failures of introspective belief are the norm. Failures of instrumental
desire are the exception. I have two responses to this kind of pessimism
about introspective belief. The first is that it vastly overstates the
case. To say that failures of introspective belief are the norm is to
overlook the wide range of cases where introspective belief is utterly
unproblematic. Over a vast range of mundane beliefs, desires, and other
mental states, I have utterly unproblematic introspective access. If
failures of introspective belief were the norm here, our mental life
would be in serious trouble. The second response is that nothing in the
argument from cognitive dynamics depends on an overly optimistic view of
our capacity for introspective belief. It may well be that failures of
local rationality are far more common in the case of introspective
beliefs, but as long as introspective beliefs have some of the features
I draw attention to below, the argument from cognitive dynamics will go
through. This is a point I will return to after presenting the rest of
the argument.</p>
<p>How could a cognitive system exhibit these dynamics? Again, assuming
a broadly functionalist picture of beliefs and desires, we can recast
the observation in the following terms. When someone comes to be in a
state which plays the <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-that-P-role, they come to be
in a state which plays the believing-that-one-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-s-that-P-/-to-<span
class="math inline"><em>Φ</em></span>-role, insofar as they are rational
and have some interest in the question of whether they <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> that P. When someone ceases to be
in a state which plays the <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-that-P-role, they cease to be
in a state which plays the believing-that-one-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-s-that-P-role. Again, two
importantly different hypotheses arise concerning the identity of these
states.</p>
<p>According to one hypothesis, call it the <em>causal hypothesis</em>,
the dynamics are explained by the fact that when someone comes to be in
a state which plays the <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-that-P-role, they are caused
to come to be in a state which plays the believing-that-one-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-s-that-P-role, insofar as they are
rational and have some interest in the question of whether they <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-that-P. And someone ceases to be
in a state which plays the <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-that-P-role, they are caused
to cease to being in a state which plays the believing-that-one-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-s-that-P-role. On this hypothesis
the cognitive dynamics are explained by various causal transactions
between constitutively distinct states or events involving these
states.</p>
<p>According to another hypothesis, call it the <em>constitutive
hypothesis</em>, the dynamics are explained by the fact that when
someone comes to be in a state which plays the <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-that-P-role, they thereby come
to be in a state which plays the believing-that-one-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-s-that-P-role, since the former
state plays the latter role. And when someone ceases to be in a state
which plays the <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing-that-P-role, they thereby
cease being in a state which plays the believing-that-one-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-s-that-P-role, since it was the
former state which played the latter role. On this hypothesis the
cognitive dynamics are explained by the states which play the
first-order roles playing the second-order roles.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Each of these hypotheses is clearly an empirical hypothesis. What
arguments can be given for and against? Not surprisingly, the
considerations are perfectly analogous to those given in the argument
from cognitive dynamics for constitutivism about instrumental
desire.</p>
<p>Perhaps the weakest consideration in favour of the constitutive
hypothesis, but a consideration nonetheless, comes from the relative
cognitive efficiency of having the states which play the roles of
particular mental states also play the role of beliefs about those
mental states, rather than having the former be distinct from and caused
by the latter. A cognitive system requires far fewer distinct states and
fewer dependencies between them in order to have a wide range of
introspective beliefs on the constitutive hypothesis. This consideration
has considerable bite in contemporary contexts where doubt has arisen,
both on the basis of philosophical and empirical enquiry, concerning the
claim that we have a distinct perception-like capacity for inner-sense,
one which causally detects our mental states and outputs introspective
beliefs. This view goes hand in hand with the causal hypothesis. The
constitutive hypothesis cuts out the middle-man, and requires no
distinct perception-like capacity for inner-sense.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
To sum up the points of this paragraph in slogan form: <em>the
constitutive hypothesis is cognitively more efficient than the causal
hypothesis</em>.</p>
<p>A stronger consideration in favour of the constitutive hypothesis
comes from the observation that the causal-roles which are definitive of
many mental states, along with the principles of rationality, predict
that by merely being in those mental states, and being rational, an
agent will be disposed to act <em>as if</em> she believes that she is in
those mental states.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> In particular, it has been observed
that if you are in pain, say, and you are rational, you will be
disposed, partly in virtue of the fact that you are in pain, to say ‘I
am in pain’. This point has been made over and over by expressivists in
the philosophy of introspection, who take it to show that statements
like ‘I am in pain’ do not report mental states but merely express them.
But we needn’t take the claim in this vein, since it is possible that
such statements both report and express mental states, because the
mental states they express double, according to the constitutive
hypothesis, as beliefs about those mental states. If introspectively
believing that you are in a particular mental state were a matter of
coming to be in a distinct state which plays the role of a belief that
you are in some mental state, as the causal hypothesis holds, then the
disposition to act as if you believed that you were in that mental state
would be over-determined. There’s nothing by way of the agent’s
dispositions to act that being in this distinct state would contribute
which is not already contributed by their being in the first-order
state, their having an interest in the question of whether they are in
that state, and their being fully rational. The state is motivationally
redundant.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> So, to put the point in slogan
form: <em>the constitutive hypothesis avoids the prediction that
introspective beliefs are motivationally redundant.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest consideration in favour of the constitutive
hypothesis, the one that I am willing to put the most weight on, begins
with an observation about the strength of the dependence of
introspective beliefs on the mental states they are about. As we saw
earlier, one claim about the cognitive dynamics of introspective belief
is that if someone introspectively believes that they <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> that P, and they cease <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-ing that P, then they will cease
believing that they <span class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> that
P.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> While this claim is compatible with
both the constitutive and causal hypotheses, the constitutive hypothesis
has a far better explanation of it. Indeed, the explanation comes for

one ceases to be in the state which plays the believing-that-one-<span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-s-that-P-role, one will cease
believing that one <span class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> that P.
The causal hypothesis requires the auxiliary hypothesis here that when
the state which plays the believing-that-one-<span

explained by the state which plays the <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span>-that-P-role, it will remain
causally dependent on this state. Of course, it is possible that, simply
as a matter of fact, such a state will remain causally dependent on this
other state. But this claim has to be added as an auxiliary hypothesis

than the constitutive hypothesis. And, moreover, there is every reason
to think that this causal dependence would sometimes break down, giving
rise to stray introspective beliefs, <em>introspective</em> beliefs
which are no longer dependent on the mental states which caused them in
the first place. But if this phenomenon exists in our psychology, it
remains unobserved. The constitutive hypothesis correctly predicts that
there will be no stray introspective beliefs. And this is a significant
point in its favour. So, to sum up the points of this paragraph in
slogan form: <em>introspective beliefs are deeply dependent on other
mental states for their existence and the constitutive hypothesis best
explains this</em>.</p>
<p>While Shoemaker is more closely associated with the argument from
necessitation, it is clear that he also has something like the argument
from cognitive dynamics in mind. Indeed, I think that, to the extent
that he does have the latter in mind, this is the best argument he has
for constitutivism about introspective belief. Consider the following
passage from a recent paper of Shoemaker’s defending constitutivism
about introspective belief:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might, indeed, wonder whether there is any need to postulate
standing second-order beliefs that self-ascribe available first-order
beliefs. It goes with having the available first-order belief that
<em>p</em> that if the question whether one believes that <em>p</em>
arises, one will judge that one does—one will assent to the proposition
that one believes that <em>p</em>. But this seems to be the result of
one’s having the belief that <em>p</em>, not the result of one’s having
a second-order belief whose cognitive dynamics is independent of that of
the belief that <em>p</em>, in the way that the cognitive dynamics of
one’s belief about another person’s belief is independent of that of the
other person’s belief. It would seem inefficient for our psychology to
involve the storage of standing second-order beliefs ascribing available
first-order beliefs, if there is nothing for these second-order beliefs
to do that is not done by the first-order beliefs themselves. <span
class="citation" data-cites="shoemaker2012">(Shoemaker 2012,
247)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These remarks combine elements of all three of the considerations I
have given above. Shoemaker makes a claim about efficiency, there is
also a claim about redundancy, and he speaks of the predicted cognitive
independence of introspective beliefs from the mental states they are
about on the causal hypothesis. I have teased out these considerations
and argued that together they add up to a reasonable case for the
constitutive hypothesis.</p>
<p>The best argument, then, for constitutivism about introspective
belief is the argument from cognitive dynamics. Unlike the argument from
necessitation for constitutivism about introspective belief, which would
decisively establish constitutivism about introspective belief if it
were cogent, the argument from cognitive dynamics makes constitutivism
about introspective belief the conclusion of an ordinary argument to the
best explanation. But it isn’t really surprising that this should be so,
since constitutivism about introspective belief is a contingent
hypothesis about introspective beliefs.</p>
<p>To end, let me return to the obvious line of criticism which may be
raised against the argument from cognitive dynamics for constitutivism
about introspective belief. The criticism is basically that it depends
on far too rosy a picture of introspective belief. But we are now in a
position to see that it does not. The consideration about efficiency
requires only that we have a significant number of introspective
beliefs, so that considerations of efficiency come into play. It doesn’t
require that we approximate omniscience and infallibility. The
considerations about redundancy, likewise, only require that we have a
significant number of introspective beliefs, so that considerations
about redundancy come into play. And, finally, considerations about deep
dependence do not require that we are rarely in error about our own
mental states. This is an important point. We may have many false
beliefs about our own mental states. We may often be in error about our
own mental states. But as long as those beliefs about our own mental
states arrived at by introspection remain deeply dependent on the mental
states they are about—that is, as long as there are no stray
<em>introspective</em> beliefs—the point about dependence holds.</p>

data-cites="stoljar2018">(Stoljar 2018)</span> for a discussion of
further ways of refining such claims. For the purposes of the argument,
all that matters is that there is some non-trivial, finite, mental
condition which necessitates the introspective belief.<a href="#fnref7"

<li id="fn8"><p>While the objection, in its essentials, is due to Kind,
the specific development of the objection made here is original to this

<li id="fn9"><p>In both Kind and Gertler’s discussions, there is an
appeal to causation, and a contrast between causation and constitution,
which is not made in the presentation of the objection here.<a

<li id="fn10"><p>The supervenience claim is the conclusion of
Shoemaker’s famous argument from self-blindness. See <span

<li id="fn11"><p>Kieran Setiya argues that a nearby necessitation claim
is true, and that this is what Shoemaker has correctly drawn attention
to <span class="citation" data-cites="setiya2011">(Setiya 2011)</span>.
But what gets necessitated, according to Setiya, is a capacity for
introspective belief, not introspective belief itself.<a href="#fnref11"

<li id="fn15"><p>This might be a little bit unfair to the causal
hypothesis. Since there is a version of the causal hypothesis which cuts
out the middle-man too, and requires no distinct perception-like
capacity for inner-sense. My point here is that once we are on the look
out for cognitively efficient hypotheses about introspective beliefs,
the constitutive hypothesis wins hands down.<a href="#fnref15"

<li id="fn16"><p>This point is well made by <span class="citation"
data-cites="shoemaker1996">(Shoemaker 1996)</span>. While Shoemaker
makes the point in the context of arguing for the necessitation or
supervenience claim, I am here making in the context of the cognitive
dynamics argument. Shoemaker sometimes says things which suggest that he
might have something like the cognitive dynamics argument in mind. This
is a point I will come to in the text.<a href="#fnref16"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>To be clear: I am not denying that introspective
beliefs themselves are motivationally redundant, that they make no
difference to the cognitive functioning of the mental states they are
about; I am only claiming that a distinct state which had these
consequences would be redundant insofar as being in the mental states in
question, having an interest in the question of whether you are in those
mental states, and being fully rational would already have the
consequences for one’s cognitive life we take introspective beliefs to
have.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back"
