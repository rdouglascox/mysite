<p> I'm a philosopher based at the University of Sydney in
the Discipline of Philosophy in the School of Humanities. </p>

<p> I am interested in a wide range of philosophical topics,
but tend to think and write about issues in the following
three double-barrelled areas: moral and political
philosophy, the philosophy of mind and action, and the
philosophy of logic and language.  
</p>

<p> I have recently written on the relationship between
democracy and social equality and on questions related to
political legitimacy and Indigenous justice.  I have also
written on philosophical issues relating to our knowledge of
our own minds, in particular our knowledge of our own
reasons for acting and holding particular attitudes, and on
issues relating to the syntax and semantics of
why-interrogatives. To find out more about my published
research, visit my <a href="./research.html">research</a>
page.</p>

<p>  I am currently working on philosophical issues relating
to educational justice, political legitimacy, the nature of
political philosophy, first-person
thought, and the role of
perspectival thought in the humanities. To find out more
about my current research visit my <a href="./research.html">research</a> page.</p>

<p> I regularly teach two units at the University of Sydney,
PHIL2635 Contemporary Political Philosophy and the July
Intensive iteration of PHIL1012 Introductory Logic. I often
teach into other courses, like PHIL1013 Society, Knowledge
and Self, and PHIL3686 Core Issues in Practical Philosophy.
To find out more about my teaching visit my <a href="./teaching.html">teaching</a> page.</p>

<p> I live in Sydney with <a href="https://www.luaraferracioli.com">my
	partner</a> and our three children.  </p>

<p> You can find me on PhilPapers <a href="https://philpapers.org/s/Ryan%20Cox">here</a>
