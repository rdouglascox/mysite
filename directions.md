title: Finding My Office and the Philosophy Seminar Room
---

My office and the Philosophy Seminar Room are in the Quadrangle.

The Quadrangle is visible from almost everywere on campus. Just look for the clock tower.

To get to my office, you enter the Quadrangle via the entrance on the left as you face the clock tower. You go up the stairs and turn left. My office is on your left.

To get to the Philosophy Common Room, turn right after going up the stairs. The Philosophy Common Room is the first door on the left. 

To get to the Philosophy Seminar Room (N494) you can either enter via the entrance on the left as you face the clock tower, go up the stairs, and then go all the way along the main corridor until you see room N494 on you right. Alternatively, you can enter via the door on the left, go up the stairs and turn left, proced a little while until you see room N494 on your left.
